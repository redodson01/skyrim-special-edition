By default there are three nude options available that don't require anything but installation, as well as two underwear styles for these body shapes.\n<br />\n<br />Also included are all vanilla and DLC outfits converted to the base three body shapes, with additional BodySlide compatibility including sliders and many zaps.\n<br />\n<br />The body mesh is completely custom and has 13554 vertices, which is more than 20 times the resolution of the vanilla Skyrim body and 6 times that of the older CBBE. Included are textures made from photographs of real women, and multiple choices of high-res normal maps to fit the body shape you want.  Also redone are the mesh weights for animation, offering improved deformation in many poses.\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue]Note to modders:\n<br />[/color]If you wish to create armour/clothes for the bodies, make use of the conversion references coming with BodySlide in Outfit Studio (the base shape of CBBE, otherwise the \"Outfit\" presets) or your preferred modelling software. Ideally, create BodySlide projects so that your outfits will fit regardless of shape preset.\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue][size=3]Discord[/size][/color]\n<br />[url=https://discord.gg/2qg2Rzw][img]https://i.imgur.com/QI1YKyD.png[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/uawVAdg.png[/img]\n<br />The following are installation options for different body shapes as well as underwear styles.\n<br />All of these shapes support the weight slider from 0% to 100% in the game.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=powderblue]Shape Options[/color][/size]\n<br />[color=#b0e0e6]Slim[/color]:\n<br />- Default CBBE body with a natural shape of slimmer ladies.\n<br />[color=powderblue]Curvy[/color]:\n<br />- Based on the original CBBE\n<br />- More voluptuous than \"Slim\", but still realistic in its proportions.\n<br />[color=powderblue]Vanilla[/color]:\n<br />- Based on the Vanilla body made to work with CBBE textures.\n<br />- Thicker waist, lowered breasts and more defined pelvis region.\n<br />[color=powderblue]NeverNude[/color]:\n<br />- Vanilla-styled underwear.\n<br />[color=powderblue]Underwear[/color]:\n<br />- Modern style underwear in five colours (black, purple, red, light blue, and a plain grey) and an optional more revealing style.\n<br />\n<br />More options available with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201]BodySlide[/url], including zap options (to remove parts) and many outfits.\n<br />\n<br />For body presets, have a look at Jeir's [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11229]CBBE Presets Compendium[/url] or search Nexus Mods for tons of them.\n<br />You are going to find one you love for sure!\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=powderblue]Skin Options[/color][/size]\n<br />[color=powderblue]Default Skin[/color]:\n<br />- Clean, smooth and hairless textures.\n<br />[color=powderblue]Pubic Hair[/color]:\n<br />- Default textures with pubic hair.\n<br />\n<br />For more texture options, such as innies or dirt, check out the resources in the misc. files section.\n<br />If you want to use entirely different skin textures for CBBE, check out the list of compatible mods or search the Nexus!\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=powderblue]Normal Map Options[/color][/size]\n<br />\"Normal maps\" are a type of texture that is going to define how your body is being affected by light.\n<br />Installing the right normal map is going to make sure the body is being lit/shaded in a way you want it to look like.\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue]Base[/color]:\n<br />- Default normal map that comes with the main CBBE installer. Works well enough for a lot of body shapes.\n<br />[color=powderblue]Petite[/color]:\n<br />- Less shading for the breast area compared to the base map. Better for body shapes with much smaller breasts.\n<br />[color=powderblue]Curvier[/color]:\n<br />- More shading for the breast area compared to the base map. Better for body shapes with larger breasts.\n<br />[color=powderblue]Cleavage[/color]:\n<br />- More shading for the upper breast area to provide a nice look of cleavage. Works well for outfits.\n<br />[color=powderblue]SevenBase[/color]:\n<br />- Shading that matches the SevenBase body shape. Recommended to use only with CBBE SevenBase preset from BodySlide.\n<br />[color=powderblue]SevenBase Muscular[/color]:\n<br />- Same as SevenBase, but with muscle definition.\n<br />[color=powderblue]Muscular[/color]:\n<br />- Provides abs and a little bit of definition for the inner thighs and butt.\n<br />[color=powderblue]Fetish[/color]:\n<br />- More defined nipple and areola shape. A little bit of abs and curvy breasts. Recommended to use with matching preset from BodySlide.\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][color=powderblue]Physics Bodies[/color][/size]\n<br />After installing CBBE, your BodySlide program will have a new entry \"CBBE Body Physics\" for basic breast and butt physics.\n<br />It's only available in BodySlide, not in the main CBBE installer.\n<br />\n<br />Additionally, there is a \"CBBE Body Special\" available in BodySlide.\n<br />With this body, you will receive a 3D labia mesh. The labia requires the body textures to be compatible with it, so keep this in mind when using third party CBBE textures.\n<br />\n<br />Make sure to check out the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174]CBBE 3BA[/url] or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29023/]CBBE SMP[/url] bodies for advanced physics and other additions as well.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff0000]WARNING:\n<br />[/color]All of these physics bodies absolutely require you to have the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988/]XPMSSE[/url] skeleton installed, or your game will crash!\n<br />Additionally, you need a physics system such as [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21224]CBPC[/url] or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339]HDT SMP[/url].\n<br />[size=3][color=powderblue]\n<br />RaceMenu BodyMorph[/color][/size]\n<br />BodyMorph is a system part of the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080]RaceMenu[/url] mod that lets you morph bodies and outfits live in-game.\n<br />\n<br />To make use of it, choose the \"RaceMenu Morphs\" option in the CBBE installer and make sure to build all of your bodies and outfits using the \"Build Morphs\" checkbox in the BodySlide program.\n<br />\n<br />To get load/save functionality of body presets in-game in RaceMenu, the two mods [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13048]PapyrusUtil[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17561]UIExtensions[/url] are required.\n<br />[size=3][color=powderblue]\n<br />Plugins[/color][/size]\n<br />[color=powderblue]CBBE.esl/esp[/color]:\n<br />- Required for rim-lighting version only. Disable if using the non-rim-lighting version. \"ESPFE\" plugin that doesn't take up a plugin slot (as it's an ESL-flagged esp).\n<br />[color=#b0e0e6]RaceMenuMorphsCBBE.esp[/color]:\n<br />- Comes with the RaceMenu Morphs option (see above). Can not be converted to an ESL plugin!\n<br />[size=3][color=powderblue]\n<br />Recommended Mods[/color][/size]\n<br />The following are recommended mods to check out that are a good fit for CBBE.\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90713]Female Hands Redone:[/url] Overhaul for hands with additional BodySlide sliders.\n<br />- ﻿[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78090]NecDaz Feet:[/url] Overhaul for feet with different proportions.\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/798]Fair Skin Complexion:[/url] Overhaul of all textures used for female characters.\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45718]Diamond Skin:[/url] Female skin textures based on Fair Skin Complexion.\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65274]BnP - Female Skin:[/url] Semi-realistic, meticulously crafted high-quality skin texture replacer.\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20078]Bijin Skin:[/url] Female skin textures used by Bijin NPCs.\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/184]Feminine Argonian Textures:[/url] Overhaul for Argonian body textures.\n<br />- [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TbQaDCEIdFMzAAd-0OJnGleYzwMeSi4XqVZlg7S4x-I]List of CBBE-compatible mods[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/xXsc576.png[/img]\n<br />Installation of the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266]Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch (USSEP)[/url] is highly advised to fix a lot of issues related to vanilla outfits (and the game in general).\n<br />It is also highly recommended to use a [b]mod manager[/b] to make it easier to install and uninstall mods.\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue]Mod Managers (Vortex, Mod Organizer, NMM, ...)[/color]\n<br />The included installer can be used with any mod manager that supports \"FOMod\" installers, such as the ones listed above.\n<br />\n<br />Simply download the main file to your mod manager and install/enable it.\n<br />Make sure to run the installation using the installer and follow its instructions.\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue]Wrye Bash[/color]\n<br />Download the main file and copy it into the installers tab.\n<br />\n<br />Check the \"FOMod\" box above the Sub-packages pane for scripted installation, or check the boxes of what you wish to install in the Sub-Packages pane.\n<br />Right click the archive and choose \"Install\".\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue]Manual[/color]\n<br />If you are an advanced user/modder, the mod may also be installed manually.\n<br />\n<br />Download the main file and open the archive using [url=https://7-zip.org/]7-zip[/url]﻿.\n<br />Install the [i]contents[/i] of the \"00 Required (Slim)\" folder into the \"Data\" folder of your game installation.\n<br />\n<br />Any other of the numbered folders are optional and may also be installed into the \"Data\" folder.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/lrW7B26.png[/img]\n<br />[color=powderblue][size=3]Q1:[/size] Why does this affect NPCs and how can I make this player-only?[/color]\n<br />A: All adult female characters use the exact same meshes/textures, bar the Beast and elderly races/characters, who have some texture differences. To make this player-only, one option is to install and play as a modded standalone race or use a unique player mod, but this comes with various issues. Preferably, install a base CBBE body shape (and corresponding outfits) that all NPCs will use, and use the in-game RaceMenu Morphs for your character only. Requires RaceMenu, the Morphs plugin, and BodySlide. This option means you can also use things such as BodyGen, OBody or AutoBody to have further control in NPC body shapes.\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue][size=3]Q2:[/size] What are the CBBE.esp or RaceMenuMorphsCBBE.esp plugin files for?[/color]\n<br />A: Please check the \"Plugins\" section under \"Options\" above for info on what they do and why they exist.\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue][size=3]Q3a:[/size] Why are the bodies not changing after I install?[/color]\n<br />A1: You didn't install the armour/clothing replacer in this mod (nor a separate one) and/or are not looking at a nude female adult character.\n<br />A2: If NPCs have changed but your character hasn't, you're using a custom race (or similar) and didn't copy over the meshes/textures into the race's folders.\n<br />A3: You're not using a legal copy of the game. Buy the game legally and you're all set.\n<br />A4: If you're using NMM, make sure you're using the latest files from GitHub. If using Vortex/MO2 and BodySlide, make sure those mod managers are using your preset and not a default CBBE body.\n<br />A5: If (some) NPCs haven't changed, but your character (and other NPCs) has, you have a mod that makes them standalone (custom followers, possibly 'Bijins'). You will have to manually add the meshes and textures to their folders.\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue][size=3]Q3b:[/size] Why are the outfits not changing after I install?[/color]\n<br />A: Outfits in Skyrim don't work the same was as in real life. They don't go over the body, they replace the body. Thus the body shape when wearing an outfit will be whatever shape the outfit was made for. If you want the outfits to match your CBBE base or BodySlide bodies, you need to install CBBE or BodySlide-compatible outfit mods. This mod comes with vanilla outfit replacers. Consult the mod list for other CBBE-compatible mods.\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue][size=3]Q4:[/size] How do I swap between the different body types?[/color]\n<br />A: Reinstall/use BodySlide to generate new body meshes. You [i]will[/i] need to reinstall if you want to change from one texture set to another if you don't know how to do it manually.\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue][size=3]Q5:[/size] Is this mod compatible with [i]x mod[/i]?[/color]\n<br />A: If it's a female body mod, then no. If it's a face retexture mod, and you haven't installed the FacePack, then yes, as long as it's compatible with the CBBE seams. If it's an armour/clothing mod...consult the CBBE mod list, as only outfit mods that were made for the current version of CBBE, or else don't show much/any skin, will work without major issues. If it's a standalone race mod/follower, you'll need to manually copy/paste CBBE textures into that mod's folders. Anything else will be fine.\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue][size=3]Q6:[/size] Can you make a body texture with pubic hair/tattoos/dirt/argonian support?[/color]\n<br />A: There are many mods in the mod list that have different features such as scars and dirt, and different skin types.\n<br />Some pubic hair/dirt options are in the installer or texture resources.\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue][size=3]Q7:[/size] How do I get body physics/jellyboobs/all dem jiggles hurhurhur?[/color]\n<br />A: Install [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21224]CBPC[/url] (or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339]HDT SMP[/url]), [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988]XPMSSE[/url], and build the CBBE Body Physics (or Special) body in BodySlide.\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue][size=3]Q8:[/size] Why do I get gaps at the hips/misplaced textures when nude?[/color]\n<br />A: You are not using CBBE textures on CBBE meshes. Reinstall, and make sure all the necessary files are in the correct place. Argonians do not have texture support with CBBE - you will have to get them elsewhere (see: mod list, or the recommended mods listed above).\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue][size=3]Q9:[/size] Why do I get gaps at the hips/misplaced textures with certain outfits/outfits made for other body mods?[/color]\n<br />A: In games, the outfit defines the mesh/shape, but both the body and the outfit use the same skin texture. CBBE has a different UV map to the vanilla/other bodies. UV maps are how the textures line up on the meshes. Due to the different UV maps, CBBE textures will not line up correctly on vanilla/other mod meshes.\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue][size=3]Q10:[/size] I have the 'dark head bug'/'light head bug'/face-colour-doesn't-match-body-colour bug. How do I fix this?[/color]\n<br />A: If it's with NPCs, then you've altered them in some way (even if it's just removing dirt or changing their weight), and need to generate facegen data. Have a look at various 'how to create a follower/NPC' tutorials for help. Note that this can happen even if you have the facegen data generated, if you've already encountered the NPC in your game. You may also need to edit your load order to deal with conflicts.\n<br />Also note that if you have several mods that affect NPC appearance (e.g. ECE, EEO, [b]and[/b] NPC-appearance replacer mods) then the wrong load order with these mods' plugins can also cause issues. You may need to manually move them up/down your load order to find out the right place for them.\n<br />If it's with the player character, there's no known fix. If it's with a vampire character, then blame BethSoft as it's an issue with the vanilla game.\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue][size=3]Q11:[/size] I tried installing manually, but I can't extract the archive, why?\n<br />[/color]A: [url=https://7-zip.org/]Use 7-zip[/url] for manual extraction - it's 100% free, works, and doesn't screw up the archives. 7zip's been the modder's choice archiver for more than two decades, for good reason.\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue][size=3]Q12:[/size] B'aww, this mod causes my game to crash![/color]\n<br />A: No, it doesn't. There is nothing in this mod that would cause your game to crash, unless your hardware isn't good enough to render the 4k uncompressed ultra textures which are the default ones (fix; use lower res textures); you have mods than add to the game's instability, or you generated the Physics Body in BodySlide without installed XPMSSE. Check your mods, and learn to love LOOT, SSEEdit and Wrye Bash.\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue][size=3]Q13:[/size] Can I use outfits/presets/bodies/anything-that-isn't-CBBE-textures made for Skyrim Legendary/'Oldrim's' CBBE with this?[/color]\n<br />A: No. You'll break things. Don't do it. They need to be converted to the new CBBE first.\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue][size=3]Q14:[/size] Will you put this on Bethesda.net?[/color]\n<br />A: CBBE and its outfits are [url=https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4063300]now on Bethesda.net[/url].\n<br />\n<br />[color=powderblue][size=3]Q15:[/size] Why doesn't SSE CBBE have a belly node?[/color]\n<br />A: In LE, one of the spine nodes was sacrificed to provide a belly node, resulting in sub-optimal animations but providing belly scaling/'physics'. In SSE, all of the spine nodes are used on the spine, meaning animations are as good as they can ever be. Nodes can not be added, and we are not willing to sacrifice one of the spine nodes again. RaceMenu SE has been released with support for body morphs, mods can use this scaling system for the belly instead.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/cSsp41F.png[/img]\n<br />CBBE is a simple mod on a technical level. All that is needed for it to work correctly is for it to replace the right files.\n<br />\n<br />Make sure your mod manager is correctly set up and the CBBE mod is installed and enabled.\n<br />\n<br />Don't forget about checking for file conflicts to make sure the body files are overwritten in the order you want your body-related mods to load in.\n<br />You can only have one body mod replacing the bodies of default races at the same time!\n<br />\n<br />[b]Check out the FAQ section of this mod page for more help and tips.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />The main files responsible for the default race bodies are the following:\n<br />[spoiler]textures/actors/character/female/femalebody_1.dds\n<br />textures/actors/character/female/femalebody_1_msn.dds\n<br />textures/actors/character/female/femalebody_1_sk.dds\n<br />textures/actors/character/female/femalebody_1_s.dds\n<br />textures/actors/character/female/femalehands_1.dds\n<br />textures/actors/character/female/femalehands_1_msn.dds\n<br />textures/actors/character/female/femalehands_1_sk.dds\n<br />textures/actors/character/female/femalehands_1_s.dds\n<br />textures/actors/character/female/femalebodyafflicted.dds\n<br />textures/actors/character/female/astridbody.dds\n<br />textures/actors/character/female/astridbody_msn.dds\n<br />textures/actors/character/femaleold/femalebody_1_msn.dds\n<br />textures/actors/character/femaleold/femalehead_msn.dds\n<br />textures/actors/character/femalekhajiit/femalebody.dds\n<br />textures/actors/character/femalekhajiit/femalebody_msn.dds\n<br />textures/actors/character/femalekhajiit/femalehands.dds\n<br />textures/actors/character/femalekhajiit/femalehands_msn.dds\n<br />meshes/actors/character/character assets/femalebody_0.nif\n<br />meshes/actors/character/character assets/femalebody_1.nif\n<br />meshes/actors/character/character assets/femalehands_0.nif\n<br />meshes/actors/character/character assets/femalehands_1.nif\n<br />meshes/actors/character/character assets/femalefeet_0.nif\n<br />meshes/actors/character/character assets/femalefeet_1.nif\n<br />meshes/actors/character/character assets/1stpersonfemalehands_0.nif\n<br />meshes/actors/character/character assets/1stpersonfemalehands_1.nif\n<br />meshes/actors/character/character assets/1stpersonfemalebody_0.nif\n<br />meshes/actors/character/character assets/1stpersonfemalebody_1.nif\n<br />+ optionally the underwear textures, face textures, makeup/dirt masks and eyebrows, and outfit meshes.[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/6TCfirP.png[/img]\n<br />- Caliente\n<br />- ousnius\n<br />- Jeir\n<br />- Alecu for the underwear assets and design\n<br />- Acro for some of the sliders from CBBE 3BA\n<br />- killerkeo for the panty mesh used for the Falmer armor\n<br />- Lunyra for some of the blend options in the PSD resources\n<br />- XunAmarox for the innies layer in the PSD resources\n<br />- Face Pack:\n<br />  - tktk1 for Pretty Face (edited v1)\n<br />  - HHaleyy for tintmasks and (edited) specular of Fair Skin Complexion, as well as the _sk subsurface files\n<br />  - AluminumFoil for Eyebrows Match Hair (edited)"
