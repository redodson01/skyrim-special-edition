Markarth[/b][/size][/color][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#f6b26b][size=4]Description[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[size=3]If you like your cities to be busy places full to the brim with life, people, vendors and interesting things then this patch is for you.[/size]\n<br />[size=3]Jkrojmal and Vaelka each take a different approach to their city overhauls. This patch aims to bring together almost all the content from both mods and focuses on the strengths of each mod.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]So you'll still see the new structures, shrines, NPC's, pathways, hidden nooks and crannies from JK's Skyrim as well as the trees, laundry, vendors, outdoor stalls, and banners from Dawn of Skyrim. Plus lots of stylish well placed clutter to make the cities feel like real places where people live and work on a daily basis.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#f6b26b][size=4]Dynamic Vendor Displays[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[size=3]I've added a new feature to dynamically hide outdoor vendor displays during the night. I did this mainly for immersion as no vendor would leave food, weapons, jewellery etc out all night, particularly in Riften! Plus I really like the eerie empty feeling of the barren market areas during the night and conversely how they spring to life during the day. This feature has also been added to laundry so it will be removed at night in the major cities.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/ksuRZUv.jpg[/img]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b][size=4][b]Performance[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[size=3]I have an ageing GTX760 4GB and get a solid 55-60 FPS with the Official HD texture packs installed. The more textures you add to the game the more of a performance hit you will get. If you want to know how your GTX Titan Xp 12GB card will perform I'll gladly PM you my address and test it for a few months. Alternatively test it yourself with this shortcut that takes less than 2 minutes.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][i][size=3]Fire up Skyrim however don't load a save or start a new game.[/size][/i]\n<br />[*][i][size=3]At the Bethesda logo [url=http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Console]open the console[/url] and type \"coc whiterunorigin\"[/size][/i]\n<br />[*][i][size=3]You will be teleported straight into the game with the default Skyrim dragonborn and can see first hand how your setup will handle both mods.[/size][/i]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f6b26b][size=4][b]Load order[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]JKs Skyrim.esp[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Dawn of Skyrim.esp[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]JKs Skyrim_Dawn of Skyrim_Patch.esp[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#f6b26b][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=3]This is a patch and relies on content from the mods it patches.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]Most patches for the original mods will still work perfectly you just have to be smart about the load order.[/size]\n<br />[*][size=3]The following patches have been made specifically to work with this mod combo.
