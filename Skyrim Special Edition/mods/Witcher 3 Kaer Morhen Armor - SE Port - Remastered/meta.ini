nexusDescription="[color=#000000][b][u][center][size=3]Attention, please!!!\n<br />This new updated version is a whole new file. You will need to delete the old files out of your game entirely and download this newly remastered version of the mod.\n<br />I'm very sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you, but overall I think you will be very satisfied with this new version I hope!\n<br />I know I am, and feel more confident I gave you all a better version. Again this is the second mod that I have uploaded.[/size][/center][/u][/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#000000][size=4][b][i]This mod is now considered remastered from the original mod on LE because you were only able to choose between both of the textures. Now you can have both of the textures in the game with it being in the main file. We made sure this armor is craftable and temperable. The enchanting option was added to this new version as well, and this hopefully makes it an armor that will be enjoyed by all who download it. Some comments were asking if this armor could have the enchanting ability added. I'm still new to modding, so with help from mod author cunny1975 for redoing the mod for me and adding all these features this was made possible by him, and I am so grateful to him. Credit to him is now at the bottom of the page in the credit section. He and I both have tested this mod, and it worked well in our games. I'm now very proud to re-release this mod and bring it to the Nexus community. I hope you will all enjoy all this mod has to offer, and if you do enjoy it, please don't forget to endorse the mod as well. Thank you all so much for your patience and support![/i]\n<br />\n<br />[i]Best regards,[/i]\n<br />[i]LordLucian7\n<br />[center]\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]YfsFDfQjUZU[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]_pKLqAkQkiM[/youtube]﻿[/center]\n<br />[/i][/b][/size][/color][size=4]I just added a French-translated version of the main file in the optional section on 05/31/2021.

It is originally Russian ver (found in gamer-mods.ru). The problem with the Russian version is the usage of too many materials when crafting and upgrading (40 leather to upgrade 1 piece of armor? now that's madness).\n<br />I already tweaked the value and material usage. \n<br />\n<br />[size=4]\n<br />NOTE[/size]\n<br />\n<br />Since this model is ported from Witcher 3, it doesn't have a female version and slider support. Considering how bulky Geralt is, best if you play your character with 100 weight.\n<br />\n<br />This mod also comes with a dark retexture\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]INSTALLATION\n<br />\n<br />[/size]Drop everything in your data folder\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]RECOMMENDED\n<br />[/size][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71730/?]Geralt Of Rivia Voiced Follower The Witcher by imAarwyn\n<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62728/?]Swords on the back by Rakul (To equip your sword in Witcher style)[/url]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />CREDITS\n<br />[color=#000000][b][u]cunny1975 https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5790589 - For making both armor textures available in one file, and also making sure this mod offers to craft and tempering.
