nexusDescription="For the People that say it dont work.\r<br />It dont need SKSE.\r<br />SKSE is only need to detect books that you read BEFORE you install this mod and \r<br />the mcm Menu but there is a magic menu to use without SKSE.\r<br />Anything else works fine.                    \r<br />\r<br />I dont have the time to support it but everyone have the permissions to make a own version as \r<br />long as they credit the original author duggelz and give everyone the \r<br />same right to do it with your work.                     \r<br />                        \r<br />                             \r<br />\r<br />Unread Books Glow\r<br />\r<br />Books which you have not read yet will have a visible glow. When you\r<br />read a book for the first time, its glow will disappear. All copies\r<br />of the same title are considered the same book, so once you&#39;ve read\r<br />one &#34;Cats of Skyrim&#34;, you&#39;ve read them all.\r<br />\r<br />== Features ==\r<br />\r<br />* Unread books glow and have an &#34;*&#34; before their name\r<br />* Tracks books from any mod or DLC\r<br />* Spell tomes are green, skill books are red, quest books and regular\r<br />books are various shades of blue\r<br />* Settings configured in-game via spell\r<br />\r<br />== Install ==\r<br />\r<br />Nexus Mod Manager: Click the &#34;Download with Manager&#34; button. Once\r<br />it&#39;s downloaded, in the Nexus Mod Manager, click on the &#34;Mods&#34; tab,\r<br />and double-click on &#34;Unread Books Glow&#34; to activate it.\r<br />\r<br />\r<br />== Upgrade ==\r<br />\r<br />If you&#39;re upgrading from a previous version, you might see odd\r<br />behavior until you enter a new location.\r<br />\r<br />== Uninstall ==\r<br />\r<br />Move your character to an interior location that has no unread books.\r<br />Save your game and exit Skyrim.\r<br />\r<br />Nexus Mod Manager: Click on the &#34;Mods&#34; tab, double-click on &#34;Unread\r<br />Books Glow&#34; to deactivate it, then click &#34;Delete&#34;.\r<br />\r<br />== Limitations ==\r<br />\r<br />* Books you&#39;ve read before installing this mod are not recorded. You will have to read\r<br />them again.\r<br />* Only the nearest 100 books are affected in any location.\r<br />* Books in containers and merchant inventories are usually not\r<br />recognized as unread.\r<br />* Quest books added by DLC and other mods are treated as &#34;plain&#34; books.\r<br />Spell tomes and skill books should work fine.\r<br />\r<br />== Configuration ==\r<br />\r<br />Open the in-game &#34;Magic&#34; menu,\r<br />select &#34;Powers&#34;, and select &#34;{Unread Books Glow Settings}&#34;. Then exit\r<br />the menu. Your character will appear to have a spell readied. Cast\r<br />the spell as normal (usually just clicking the left mouse button) and\r<br />a settings menu will appear.\r<br />\r<br />== Compatibility ==\r<br />\r<br />This mod should automatically handle books added by DLC and other\r<br />mods. However, there might be conflicts with other mods that change\r<br />the behavior of books in general. If you find something noteworthy\r<br />that does or doesn&#39;t work, let me know and I will add it here.\r<br />\r<br />Compatible:\r<br />* Better Skill and Quest Books Names\r<br />* Book Covers Skyrim\r<br />* Bookshelves Script SKSE\r<br />* Improved Skill Books\r<br />* Non-Automatic Skill Books\r<br />* Read And Learn Speechcraft Speech\r<br />* Sometimes Pick Up Books\r<br />\r<br />Maybe Compatible:\r<br />* Unlimited Bookshelves (works for some people, not for others)\r<br />\r<br />Probably Not Compatible:\r<br />* Deja Vu - I Already Read It\r<br />* Mark Books as Read\r<br />\r<br />== Distribution ==\r<br />\r<br />This file is available on the Skyrim Nexus\r<br />\r<br />== Translations ==\r<br />\r<br />French: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1716/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1716/?[/url]\r<br />Polish: [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2109/?]http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2109/?[/url]\r<br />\r<br />== Credits ==\r<br />\r<br />Bethesda for the Skyrim Creation Kit.\r<br />Fallout Mod Manager (FOMM) for TESsnip and BSA Browser.\r<br />LHammonds Readme Generator.\r<br />The SKSE team for tireless work.\r<br />The SkyUI team for awesome improvements.\r<br />The Tes5Edit team for their tools.\r<br />The Skyrim Nexus for hosting.\r<br />duggelz for the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10012/?]Original Version[/url]\r<br />\r<br />== History ==\r<br />\r<br />1.0, 2012/02/11 - Initial release.\r<br />1.1, 2012/02/16 - Complete rewrite.\r<br />1.2, 2012/02/20 - Fixed various bugs, made &#34;Medium&#34; the default for new games.\r<br />1.3, 2012/02/24 - Second attempt to fix &#34;books stop glowing&#34; bug.\r<br />1.4, 2012/07/22 - Updated for Skyrim version 1.6.\r<br />1.5, 2012/08/04 - Dawnguard DLC support, minor bugfixes, minor change for SkyUI.\r<br />1.5.1, 2012/08/18 - Identical to 1.5, version bump for Skyrim Nexus problem.\r<br />1.5.2, 2012/09/10 - Added Czech translation.\r<br />1.5.3, 2012/09/29 - Added Polish translation.\r<br />2.0, 2013/01/15 - Added major SKSE and SkyUI enhancements.\r<br />2.0.1, 2013/01/15 - Stop using Book.IsRead(), fixed skill book color.\r<br />2.1.0, 2013/02/21 - Replaced &#34;(Unread)&#34; with &#34;*&#34;, added quest book tracking,\r<br />updated handling of SKSE Book.IsRead(),\r<br />reorganized MCM menu, added translation support.\r<br />2.2.0, 2014/01/04 - Fixed bug that made the configuration power disappear.\r<br />Added MCM translations for every language but Japanese.   \r<br />2.2.1, 2016/10.31 -This Mod now works with the Special Edition\r<br /> The old Translations and the other SKSE Features no longer work without SKSE."
