nexusDescription="Seasonal Landscapes aims to use the full potential of the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62861]Seasons of Skyrim[/url] framework to offer a unique visual style to each of Skyrim's holds for every season.\n<br />\n<br />Seasons of Skyrim's winter feature is truly impressive and makes Skyrim look entirely fresh during that season. I wanted to try and bring that same joy of rediscovering Skyrim for every season, not just Winter. This is the basis for Seasonal Landscapes.\n<br />\n<br />So now you can travel through fields of flowery green during springtime, get lost in lush and overgrown summer forests and experience how autumn casts different colours on each region.\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=5]INSTALLATION[/size][/i]\n<br />\n<br />- Install Seasons of Skyrim and all its requirements\n<br />- Install Seasonal Landscapes\n<br />- Run SSELodGen (with the seasons option checked)\n<br />- Run TexGen\n<br />- Run DynDOLOD (with the seasons option checked)\n<br />- Enjoy !\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=5]ADDITIONAL INFORMATION[/size][/i]\n<br />\n<br />This is a pretty dense grass mod so it will probably have a noticeable FPS impact on a lower end PC. You can reduce that impact by increasing the value for iMinGrassSize in the mod's .ini file but this will come at the cost of the mod's visuals.\n<br />\n<br />Seasonal Landscape does not fundamentally change vanilla trees. Any pine tree model you are using will be used ingame. The seasonal variants for aspen trees are recoloured vanilla trees (the game will use any custom model you have installed during autumn) and the reach trees are from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63623]Turn of the Seasons[/url] (originally from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52614]Reach Trees Enhanced[/url], credits to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/61720101]TateTaylorUSA[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4569617]Jelidity[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/42172895]ossumpossum[/url]), which are also based on a remeshed vanilla (the game will use any custom model you have installed during winter). A patch for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63641]Seasonal Aspen Trees[/url] is available as an optional download (and highly recommended).\n<br />\n<br />The mod contains recolours for various vanilla plants, shrubs and bushes so they blend better with the landscape during various seasons. If you wish to use custom models for those, just install them after my mod. These will replace either summer or autums plants, depending on the region. If you want to replace these assets for another season, just rename the mesh with the SUM or AUT suffix. Check out my file system, it is quite straightforward.\n<br />\n<br />I did not touch snow areas or the winter season in any major way for now, as these are hard to get right. So for example any snow grass replacer you load after my mod should apply unchanged.\n<br />\n<br />I have included a few landscape textures to help with distant terrain generation for pine forests, tundra and field grass.\n<br />\n<br />This mod uses only open permission assets. Check out the \"Permissions and credits\" section for more details.\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=5]COMPATIBILITY[/size][/i]\n<br />\n<br />- Grass mods : these will be almost completely overwritten in the Skyrim and Solstheim woldspaces. If you install them after my mod, you will still get their underwater plants and snow grass though. Grass mods will not cause any glitches, just be mostly inactive. This means you can keep them if you want them to affect Solstheim or a mod-added worldspace.\n<br />\n<br />- Tree mods that just change the models of vanilla trees : these will be mostly unaffected if you install them after my mod. Their pine trees will be active as normal, their aspen trees will be active during autumn and their Reach trees during winter. Since they do not have seasonal variants of those last two types, my modified vanilla trees will still be active during the other seasons in the Reach and Rift.\n<br />\n<br />- Tree mods that change tree records or add new trees : these will be completely unaffected. Their trees will still be there, unchanged during all seasons. This might be a little immersion breaking but making those mods seasonal would require new models and a dedicated patch. This is also true for any mod adding shrubs and bushes.\n<br />\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63463]Shrubs of Snow[/url] : mostly redundant, as I integrated most of its changes into this mod. Credits to [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/7064860]wSkeever[/url] for the cool winter models.\n<br />\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63623]Turn of the Seasons[/url] : generally incompatible as both mods change similar things. A patch is provided in the main download in order to retain TotS's beautiful frozen waterways and the changes made to Wyrmstooth. Just install TotS normally and check the icy waterways option, then let my patch overwrite the seasons folder.\n<br />\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63641]Seasonal Aspen Trees[/url] : compatible with the patch provided in the main download.\n<br />\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63604]Nature of the Wild lands[/url] : compatible with the patch provided in the main download. Designed for the main NotWL file. If there is demand for patches aimed at the NotWL optional trees, I will add them.\n<br />\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41312]Cathedral 3D Mountain Flowers[/url] : compatible with the patch provided in the main download. The patch slightly recolours summer flowers to blend in with Seasonal Landscapes' grass and adds an autumn variant. This patch only works with the original mod, not the Base Object Swapper version. The BOS form swaps have priority over Seasons of Skyrim's and you will lose the autumn flowers.\n<br />\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39998]Aspens Ablaze[/url] : compatible with the patch provided in the main download. The main Aspens Ablaze mod is required but not the Seasons Beta, which is covered by my patch.\n<br />\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19924]CACO[/url] : patch available [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69339?tab=description]here[/url], courtesy of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/591089]sidfu[/url].\n<br />\n<br />- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57874]Ulvenwald[/url] : compatible with the patch provided in the main download (requires the seasonal version of Ulvenwald)."
