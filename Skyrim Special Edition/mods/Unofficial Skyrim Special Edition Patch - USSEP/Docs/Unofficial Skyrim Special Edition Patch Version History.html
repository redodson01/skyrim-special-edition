</p>

<br>Bugs fixed by official Bethesda patches will be stricken through and the version of the game they are fixed in will be indicated in brackets.
<br><br>Bugs introduced by the USSEP (yes, it happens) that are corrected in later versions will be stricken through and tagged with the version of the USSEP that fixes them. The correction will appear separately in the version where the correction takes place.
<br><br>The <a href="https://afktrack.afkmods.com/index.php?a=issues&amp;project=6">USSEP bug tracker</a> numbers will be listed for bugs that have been recorded there when they are solved.
<br><br>All fixes are retroactive unless indicated by an [NR] tag following the fix description.
<br><br>Platform specific fixes will be marked according to which platform they affect. Either [PC] or [XB1].
<br><br>For bugs which have been fixed that also have a Bethesda support page entry, a link will be provided to the issue.
<br><br>Bug fixes based on UESP reports that don't have corresponding tracker entries will have a link to the UESP page where the bug was reported.

<p class="h">v4.3.6c (2025-08-31) [SSE 1.6.1130+]</p>
<b><u>USSEP Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The fix for Chasing Echoes dealing with Serana biting the player had a script property that had not been filled. [INFO:0200D3E0] (Bug #35799)</li>
<li>Haggling formula changes originally made in 22880 and 8551 are not actually correct. An analysis on UESP explained the reciprocity involved in the buy vs sell values and these changes should never have been made. [PERK:000BE128:Haggling00, PERK:000C07CE:Haggling20, PERK:000C07CF:Haggling40, PERK:000C07D0:Haggling60, PERK:000C07D1:Haggling80, PERK:00058F75:Allure] (Bug #33685)</li>
<li>The Unwanted Effects Remover book has been de-injected to prevent it from being removed from the game by other mods since this book is the only method available to activate the removal script.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v4.3.6b (2025-08-17) [SSE 1.6.1130+]</p>
<b><u>USSEP Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Dragon mounds where the dragon has been killed already are re-enabling the cap on the mound due to a bad script edit. The caps should only be getting enabled if the dragon is still alive at a mound. In a separate problem with the same section of the script, the transformation animation is not playing when Alduin resurrects the dragon at the mound. [Script:FXDragonMoundScript] (Bug #35749)</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v4.3.6a (2025-08-09) [SSE 1.6.1130+]</p>
<b><u>USSEP Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The trigger volume added for Halldir's Cairn was somehow set up as a solid invisible block instead of a proper trigger volume. This resulted in the dungeon becoming in accessible. [REFR:07005914] (Bug #35730)</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v4.3.6 (2025-08-02) [SSE 1.6.1130+]</p>
<b><u>USSEP Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The previous fix for your spouse telling you they're going to open a store did not work and had to be set up differently in order to properly location match for your chosen house. There is an unused location alias on RelationshipMarriageFIN (CurrentMarriageHouse). This location alias, once filled, can be used to match up when you are in a home you purchased or acquired in some other way. The Lover's Comfort benefit also needs this location to be filled to operate properly. So this is both a bug fix and a modders aid. In order to have a mod added house support the spouse asking to set up a store, one need only fill the "CurrentMarriageHouse" location alias with the proper location for a mod added house. This is especially useful for mods such as Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions and Spoused Can Live Everywhere. Since USSEP will only fill this alias for the 5 base vanilla houses, the 3 Hearthfire added houses, and the 20 Creation Club reserved houses, it will not interfere with a mod that is setting a marriage house to some other place. For a more detailed explanation of the process, there will be a post on the AFK Mods forum to outline what's needed. [INFO:000479F5, INFO:000CCD5A, INFO:000CCD5B, INFO:000CCD5C, INFO:000CCD5D, INFO:000CCD5E, INFO:000CCD5F, Script: RelationshipMarriageSpouseHouseScript] (Bug #35664)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Actor and AI Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The default sandbox package for NPCs to use in their homes is flagged to allow riding horses, which will cause them to mount an owned horse outdoors and then be unable to proceed to the interior of their home, or to get through any other load doors that may be in their way. [PACK:00031730:DefaultSandboxHomeowner] (Bug #35636)</li>
<li>Ahjisi had 2 stacks of 2 daggers in her inventory when she should only have 2 daggers in total. [NPC_:000CE086:DA05Hunter11_04Melee_Ahjisi] (Bug #35607)</li>
<li>Erdi, Odar, and Una have several idle markers in the Blue Palace which they are supposed to use but they were never added to the faction that owns the markers. [NPC_:00013271:Erdi, NPC_:0001329E:Odar, NPC_:000132AC] (Bug #35512)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Magic, Perk and Skill Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The Soul Trap effects for Halldir's Staff and Bloodthorn are missing keywords to keep them from working on Dwemer constructs. [MGEF:000FB404:dunHalldirEnchSoulTrapFFAimedArea, MGEF:000FB407:dunHagsEndSoulTrapFFContact] (Bug #35702)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Mesh and Texture Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed duplicate names, Invalid light falloff angles, and Missing EnvMap_Light_Fade flags for the entire Azura's Crystal set. [meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuraepiccrystal01.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuraepiccrystal02.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuraepiccrystal03.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuraepiccrystal04.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuraepiccrystal05.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuraepiccrystal06.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuraepiccrystal07.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargecrystal01.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargecrystal02.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargecrystal03.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargecrystal04.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargecrystal05.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargecrystal06.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargecrystal07.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargecrystalmoving01.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargecrystalmoving02.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargecrystalmoving03.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargecrystalmoving04.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargecrystalmoving05.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargecrystalmoving06.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargecrystalmoving07.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargefloorhex01.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargefloorhex02.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargefloorhex03.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargefloorhex04.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargefloorhex05.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azuralargefloorhex06.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azurascrystalcluster01.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azurascrystalcluster02.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azurascrystalcluster03.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azurascrystalcluster04.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azurascrystalcluster05.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azurascrystalcluster06.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azurasmallcrystal01.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azurasmallcrystal02.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azurasmallcrystal03.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azurasmallcrystal04.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azurasmallcrystal05.nif, meshes\dungeons\azurasstar\azurasmallcrystal06.nif] (Bug #35612)</li>
<li>Arches on the Skyhaven Temple walkway mesh are misaligned with the columns. [meshes\architecture\skyhaventemple\skyhavenexteriorwalkway02.nif] (Bug #35532)</li>
<li>Daedric bow is missing a flag to indicate it's animated. [meshes\weapons\daedric\daedricbowskinned.nif] (Bug #35642)</li>
<li>Fixed some invalid block names and removed an actor node with no purpose from the High Hrothgar tower. [meshes\architecture\HighHrothgar\highhrothgartower01.nif] (Bug #35643)</li>
<li>Fixed ragdoll issues with destroyed spider webs and wrapped human meals. [meshes\furniture\fxspiderwebkitdoorspecialdest.nif, meshes\effects\fxspiderwebkitdinnerhumangnd.nif] (Bug #35644)</li>
<li>Fixed gaps in the 3 floor Solitude stairway. [meshes\architecture\solitude\interiors\smdestasol01.nif] (Bug #35653)</li>
<li>Disabled alpha blending and added double-sided flag to the ropes on the Unholy Altar in Hjerim that's used for Blood on the Ice. [meshes\clutter\quest\ms11unholyaltar.nif] (Bug #35655)</li>
<li>Fixed normals on Serikur's house that were causing black triangles in the windows. [meshes\architecture\solitude\serikur house.nif] (Bug #35656)</li>
<li>The large entry piece for several Nord ruins had broken or jagged normals. [meshes\dungeons\nordic\exterior\dwellings\nordwelling04extbasea.nif] (Bug #35658)</li>
<li>Fixed normals and tangent spaces on the Redoran well. [meshes\dlc02\architecture\ravenrock\redoran\redoranwell01.nif] (Bug #35659)</li>
<li>Civil war cots had clipping between the fur top and the cot itself. [meshes\clutter\civilwar\civilwarcot01.nif] (Bug #35660)</li>
<li>Fixed material type and tangent spaces on jyggalag root clusters. [meshes\creationclub\bgssse025\clutter\jyggalagrootcluster01.nif] (Bug #35683)</li>
<li>Fixed material type and tangent spaces on Whiterun castle stairs. [meshes\architecture\whiterun\wrinteriors\wrcastle\wrintcastlestairs03.nif] (Bug #35684)</li>
<li>Fixed normals and tangent spaces on Windhelm docks. [meshes\architecture\windhelm\whdocks2.nif] (Bug #35685)</li>
<li>Fixed vertex positioning on an ice cave large room piece that caused it to show a gap with other parts of the kit. [meshes\dungeons\caves\ice\largeroom\caveilroomcorner03.nif] (Bug #35687)</li>
<li>Bad tangent spaces and normals on an Imperial floor piece. [meshes\dungeons\imperial\clutterkits\impfloorpiece01.nif] (Bug #35694)</li>
<li>Bad tangent spaces and normals on an Imperial wall support. [meshes\dungeons\imperial\exterior\impextsupport01.nif] (Bug #35695)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Navmesh Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Some minor issues with floating nodes have been corrected near Karthspire. [NAVM:000E81DC, NAVM:0010C6AF, NAVM:0010C6B1, NAVM:00100A22, NAVM:00104714] (Bug #35620)</li>
<li>Minor navmesh cleanup around a Civil War camp. [NAVM:000799F4, NAVM:000799FA] (Bug #35595)</li>
<li>Navmesh in Sightless Pit was a huge mess of floating nodes, triangles too high to access, triangles poking through walls, down slopes that were too steep, and passing directly through solid objects. [NAVM:000F43EF, NAVM:00028D15, NAVM:00025F5C, NAVM:00025F49, NAVM:00025F48] (Bug #35583)</li>
<li>Navmesh fixes for the Throat of the World area. [NAVM:000FA1BF, NAVM:000FA1C2, NAVM:000FA1C3, NAVM:00094140, NAVM:000FA1E0, NAVM:001069DB, NAVM:000FA1DE, NAVM:000FA1E2, NAVM:000FA1E3, NAVM:000FA1E4, NAVM:000FA1E5, NAVM:000FA1DD, NAVM:000FA1EA, NAVM:000FA1F7, NAVM:000FA1F2, NAVM:000FA1F3, NAVM:000FA1F4] (Bug #35698)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>DA05PlayerCloseInJailScript: The OnCellAttach event incorrectly attempts to delete the trigger box. This should be disabling it instead. (Bug #35696)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>In Chasing Echoes [DLC1VQ04] it is possible to get stuck in a loop where Serana tries to turn you into a vampire if you had previously elected to become a vampire and then for some reason did not enter the Soul Cairn to advance the quest. The script call that actually performs the bite has been moved from Stage 110 into the dialogue topic itself, which will run whether you'd done this portion before or not. [Scripts: DLC1_QF_VQ04Hunter_0100284F, DLC1_TIF__0100D3E0] (Bug #31654)</li>
<li>CWFortSiegeCapital does not have the "allow reserved" flag set on the player. This could cause the "Battle for ..." quests to fail startup. [QUST:00087C21:CWFortSiegeCapital] (Bug #35639)</li>
<li>Two bandits in Faldar's Tooth are supposed to run a scene where they're chatting about a card game, but the scene does its distance check on an invalid alias so it never starts before the bandits are aware of you. [SCEN:000BFFDE:dunFaldarsToothCardGameScene] (Bug #35649)</li>
<li>CurrentMarriageHouse alias on RelationshipMarriageFIN is never filled. This will cause the Lover's Comfort benefit to fail to work correctly in some conditions. [Script: RelationshipMarriageSpouseHouseScript] (Bug #35670)</li>
<li>The initial adoption of a child, and subsequent moves to new homes, are not always reliable and can fail for a variety of reasons, but mainly because the location alias handling on BYOHRelationshipAdoptionNewAdoptionHandler is set up wrong. This fix also appears to have corrected long standing issues with being able to adopt Lucia or Sofie and having them move to your house. [QUST:03003F6E:BYOHRelationshipAdoptionNewAdoptionHandler, QUST:030042B4:BYOHRelationshipAdoption, Script: BYOHRelationshipAdoptionScript] (Bug #35669)</li>
<li>When Trouble in Skyrim [CR05] sends you to Haldir's Cairn, it's possible it will have selected the wrong actor as the "leader". Since this setup is a convoluted mess that's not really feasible to work with, a brute force solution was crafted to force the alternate draugr boss into the quest's alias so that you will get credit for killing the right one. [Form added: REFR:07005914, Script added: USSEPCR05FixTriggerScript] (Bug #19604)</li>
<li>Klimmek and Gwilin do not headtrack properly for their scene in Ivarstead. [SCEN:000DD5FB:IvarsteadSSScene] (Bug #35686)</li>
<li>The "Request to Meet" note given during Staada Quest [ccBGSSSE025_StaadaQuest] is not marked as a quest item. Reading the note is a required step. The control quest which controls the status of the note will now be stopped after reading it since it serves no other purpose anyway, so that once you've read it, you will be free to get rid of it. [QUST:06198278:ccBGSSSE025_PostQuestCourierStaada] (Bug #34521)</li>
<li>In Riverwood, it is possible for Dorthe and Frodnar's scene to get called to run a second time. This is due to a leftover E3Demo node in the story manager that had no conditions. This has now been given an impossible condition to meet so that the proper node with all the conditions on it will be used instead. This likely resolves issues with either Frodnar or Dorthe getting stuck outside the inn and never moving again. [SMQN:000EAFCE:E3DemoKids] (Bug #33830)</li>
<li>In Blood on the Ice [MS11] there are several dialogue options that are still checking to see if Jorlief is the one who should be saying them. They should have been set to use the AuthorityFigure alias instead. [INFO:000E4C93, INFO:000E4C95, INFO:000E4C99, INFO:000E4CAF, INFO:000E4CC1, INFO:000E4CC8, INFO:000E4CCC, INFO:000E4CCD, INFO:000E4CCE, INFO:000E4CCF, INFO:000E4CD0, INFO:000E4CD1, INFO:000E4CD2, INFO:000E4CD3, INFO:000E4CD4] (Bug #35689)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</u></b>

<b><u>USSEP Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Several meshes from a number of previous USSEP versions were stored in incorrect folders. This has now been corrected. (Bug #34977)</li>
<li>For some unknown reason, tankards that should have been on the shelf at the end of the hallway next to the added room in The Ragged Flagon had reverted themselves back to their original vanilla positions. (Bug #35510)</li>
<li>07029011: Removed this item since it was an accidental duplicate. (Bug #35553)</li>
<li>000FA2FF: The wrong linked keyword was set on a spawner. (Bug #35048)</li>
<li>Regression fix for the Juniper bushes. [meshes\plants\florajuniper01.nif] (Bug #35055)</li>
<li>After further discussion on the issue of Red Belly Mine and what to do with the displaced ebony, it was decided to return to using Northwind Mine as the location to place it. This was originally what we had decided, and as it turns out it's also the most compatible way to address the issue should someone decide this isn't acceptable - they can simply revert 3 reference changes rather than having to deal with several additional new objects added to the game.

<p class="h">v4.3.4a (2025-02-23) [SSE 1.6.1130+]</p>
<b><u>USSEP Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an occlusion issue in Windhelm caused by the CK unexpectedly stripping required subrecord data when saving the patch.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v4.3.4 (2025-02-05) [SSE 1.6.1130+]</p>
<b><u>USSEP Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The "boss" vampire NPCs in Movarth's Lair should never have been set to be Boss reference types as neither of them is set to respawn and therefore ends up breaking radiant quests if they attempt to assign themselves to Movarth's Lair. Reverts Bug #12526. [0001F593, 000D3BEB] (Bug #34637)</li>
<li>The north gate to Riften had z-fighting introduced on the moss in USKP 1.0. This has been corrected along with the fixed UV that was done in the original fix. [meshes\architecture\riften\rtnorthgate01.nif] (Bug #34615)</li>
<li>An invalid cover flag was removed from the navmesh near Fort Sungard. (Bug #34652)</li>
<li>Previously fixed assets for the female Forsworn armor went missing from the archive at some point. The fixes have been remade using vanilla SE meshes. [meshes\clothes\forswornarmor\forswornarmorf_0.nif, meshes\clothes\forswornarmor\forswornarmorf_1.nif] (Bug #34774)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Actor and AI Fixes</u></b>
<ul>

<li>The 3 NPCs outside of Redwater Den did not have their persist locations set. (Bug #34828)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Faction Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>ccBGSSSE001_CrabMQ4GuardFaction was intended to be allies with PlayerFaction, RiftenFisheryFaction, FishermanFaction, and PlayerFollowerFaction, but the reverse affiliations were never added to the respective records so the relationships don't actually work. (Bug #34871)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Game Settings</u></b>
<ul>
<li>NPC Maximum Block Time [fCombatBlockTimeMax] is set to an insane value that will often cause them to stand in block stance "forever". It's actually about 10000 seconds, but that's close enough. It should have been set to 16 like all the other games have it. (Bug #34502)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Wedding Sandals have no footstep sounds. [WeddingSandals01AA] (Bug #34681)</li>
<li>WRWaterPool01 and Water1024WR (the ones in the pool below the Dragonsreach bridge) were incorrectly flagged by an official update to disable water displacement when swimming in them. (Bug #34771)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Magic, Perk and Skill Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Sun Bane is not marked as hostile which means it also cannot be resisted. [DLC1SunDamageFFAimedArea] (Bug #34645)</li>

<li>If Aela's Shield is pickpocketed off of here after you've given it to her (we'll ignore the ludicrousness of being able to do that), it will end up getting stacked with other common Steel Shields, causing the entire stack to in essence become her shield.

<p class="h">v4.3.2 (2024-07-11) [SSE 1.6.1130+]</p>
<b><u>USSEP Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The .esp and .bsa files have been changed to lowercase filenames. This is to help facilitate universal filename compatibility for Steam Deck and regular linux users whose file systems are case sensitive. Many of them make use of the in-game menu to download mods and Bethesda.net ALWAYS downloads in lowercase. For the benefit of people using linux or the Steam Deck, it would be greatly appreciated if any mods which currently use USSEP as a file dependency change the case of that dependency in their master lists. (Bug #34096)</li>
<li>Several Solitude meshes with ropes have been removed from the archive because they were apparently fixed in either the 1.6.1130 or 1.6.1170 official patch. This mostly reverts Bug #19524. [meshes\architecture\solitude\clutter\ssighpost02.nif, meshes\architecture\solitude\clutter\smarketstalltop.nif, meshes\architecture\solitude\clutter\sropefestivalline01.nif, meshes\architecture\solitude\clutter\sropefestivalring.nif, meshes\architecture\solitude\clutter\ssighpost.nif, meshes\architecture\solitude\clutter\ssighpost.nif] (Bug #34108)</li>
<li>The horse and rider load screen art has been reverted back to the copy from USSEP 4.3.0 due to the flag edits making the skin render either black or invisible. [meshes\loadscreenart\loadscreenhorse_and_rider.nif] (Bug #34039)</li>
<li>An old placement fix for Raven Rock Mine has been reworked to more accurately correct gaps and z-fighting in the cell. (Bug #34086)</li>
<li>Previous fix to the large metal Windhelm doors has bad tangent spaces. [meshes\architecture\windhelm\doors\whcastledoorentrance.nif] (Bug #33996)</li>
<li>A previous fix for chicken nests ended up with some of the straw turning black when eggs were harvested. [meshes\plants\chickennest01.nif, meshes\plants\switchnodechildren\chickennest01_1.nif] (Bug #33970)</li>
<li>Phase 1 of the removal of Bitterblade Hollow has been implemented. (Bug #34030)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Actor and AI Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The Imperial guard at Salvius Farm should be a "Reach Hold Guard" rather than a "Markarth City Guard" since he's not actually near the city. [GuardSalviusFarmImperial] (Bug #34024)</li>
<li>Avulstein Gray-Mane should be exempt from being chosen as a target for Hired Muscle [CR04] since he is exclusively used for a quest. (Bug #33983)</li>
<li>Haknir Death-Brand's combat class is erroneously set to favor heavy armor when his entire outfit is composed of light armor pieces. [DLC2dunHaknirClass] (Bug #32563)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Mammoth Snout [DA03FoodMammothMeat] could not be sold to food vendors because it lacked the VendorItemFood keyword. (Bug #33915)</li>
<li>Potion of Blood [DLC1BloodPotion] has the wrong usage sound attached. (Bug #34110)</li>
<li>Arcane Blacksmith's Apron [ccBGSSSE025_ClothesBlackSmith] is missing the armor addon record for Argonians, resulting in missing horns/hair. (Bug #34035)</li>
<li>Gourds are not present in the LItemFoodRawNoMeat list. (Bug #33987)</li>
<li>Venison is not present in the LItemFoodRawMeat list. (Bug #33987)</li>
<li>Vaermina's Torpor had the wrong use sound set. [DA16TorporPotion] (Bug #34171)</li>
<li>Fishing Mastery books do not have weight, unlike every other book in the game. [ccBGSSSE001_FishGuide1, ccBGSSSE001_FishGuide2, ccBGSSSE001_FishGuide3, ccBGSSSE001_FishGuide4, ccBGSSSE001_FishGuide5] (Bug #34178)</li>
<li>Potent Aversion to Magic [WeaknessMagic03] should appear in LItemPoisonWeaknessMagicBest at level 20 instead of at level 30 due to a typo when setting the list up. (Bug #33989)</li>
<li>The generic "Imperial" push button does not play an animation or sound when clicked. A script has been added to handle this. [ImpButton01] (Bug #32979)</li>
<li>Vampire Hood was incorrectly set up as Khajiit only when it should have been set up for everyone to use. This may also have resulted in decapitations on the hoods worn by Vampire Advisors. [DLC01ClothesVampireHood] (Bug #31634)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>GloomboundMine01 was assigned to a bad dummy location rather than the proper GloomboundMineLocation. The CK was also showing improper data for the main location and the dummy, which was corrected by changing the cell to the proper location. (Bug #33964)</li>
<li>IvarsteadKlimmeksHouseLocation, IvarsteadFellstarFarmLocation, IvarsteadVilemyrInnLocation: The town name is added on to the front of the actual name of the location. This is inconsistent with how every other town in the game is handled. (Bug #33981)</li>
<li>IvarsteadFellstarFarmLocation is missing the LocTypeFarm keyword. (Bug #33982)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Magic, Perk and Skill Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>FoodFortifyHealth, FoodFortifyStamina, FoodFortifyMagicka, FoodRestoreHealthDuration, and FoodRestoreStaminaDuration all lack the MagicAlchBeneficial keyword. (Bug #32975)</li>
<li>The Bullseye perk, when triggered, will immediately paralyze the target before the projectile actually hits them. This often results in them falling over before impact which then does no damage, or triggering a failed killcam that misses the target. The perk has been reworked to trigger a projectile hit monitoring event that will only paralyze the victim if they actually get hit by an attacker with a bow. Modified: Bullseye, PerkBullseyeParalyze. Added: USSEPPerkBullseyeMonitor, USSEPParalysisFFActor, USSEPPerkBullseyeEffect. (Bug #25592)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Mesh and Texture Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Further fixes for female fine clothes to close up visual gaps. [meshes\clothes\fineclothes01\outfitf_0.nif, meshes\clothes\fineclothes01\outfitf_1.nif] (Bug #34145)</li>
<li>The Whiterun drawbridge has what can only be described as an abomination attached to it in the form of exploded polygons. These exploded polygons are not visible in game but take up processing time nonetheless. [meshes\architecture\whiterun\wrdrawbridge01.nif] (Bug #34134)</li>
<li>Studded Leather ground models have the wrong havok type. Also corrected bad tangent spaces. [meshes\armor\studded\male\helmet_go.nif, meshes\armor\studded\male\boots_go.nif, meshes\armor\studded\male\gloves_go.nif] (Bug #34105)</li>
<li>Elven Armor ground models have the wrong havok type. [meshes\armor\elven\m\gauntletsgnd.nif, meshes\armor\elven\m\bootsgnd.nif, meshes\armor\elven\m\cuirassgnd.nif, meshes\armor\elven\m\cuirassheavygnd.nif] (Bug #34104)</li>
<li>Copper fireplace stacks used in Solitude are missing their collision. [meshes\architecture\solitude\interiors\sfireplacestack01.nif] (Bug #34081)</li>
<li>Bad bone weighting on Dwarven armor pieces. [meshes\armor\dwarven\dwarvenarmorf_1.nif, meshes\armor\dwarven\dwarvenarmor_0.nif, meshes\armor\dwarven\dwarvenarmor_1.nif, meshes\armor\dwarven\dwarvenarmorf_0.nif] (Bug #34072)</li>
<li>Solitude house meshes with incorrect alpha settings on some of their windows. [meshes\architecture\solitude\sbryling house.nif, meshes\architecture\solitude\serikur house.nif, meshes\architecture\solitude\svittoriavicihouse.nif, meshes\architecture\solitude\svittoriavicihousedestroyed.nif] (Bug #34047)</li>
<li>Interior metal doors in Windhelm have collision attached to the wrong parent node. [meshes\architecture\windhelm\doors\whintmetalarchdoor.nif] (Bug #34053)</li>
<li>Windhelm style fireplace: Bad collision, UV mapping errors, incorrect havok material setting which caused it to bleed when struck. [meshes\architecture\windhelm\interiorkits\castle\whfireplace01.nif] (Bug #33995)</li>
<li>Fixed the south gate mesh in Raven Rock so that you can now ride out on horseback properly. [meshes\dlc02\architecture\ravenrock\dlc2rrtunnel01.nif] (Bug #33971)</li>
<li>Farmhouse variant 1 destroyed has more visual defects: Missing roof planks, missing vertical beam on the front and back, plus some UV and transparency issues in various places. [meshes\architecture\farmhouse\farmhouse05destroyed01.nif] (Bug #33976)</li>
<li>Female necromancer robes have tearing at the bottom when moving. Male necromancer robes clip with boots. [meshes\clothes\necromancer\necromancerrobes_0.nif, meshes\clothes\necromancer\necromancerrobes_1.nif, meshes\clothes\necromancer\necromancerrobes_f_0.nif, meshes\clothes\necromancer\necromancerrobes_f_1.nif] (Bug #34202)</li>
<li>Further fixes have been done to the collision on the Dawnguard icicle clumps. [meshes\dlc01\landscape\dlc1icicleclumpcap01.nif, meshes\dlc01\landscape\dlc1icicleclumpcap02.nif, meshes\dlc01\landscape\dlc1icicleclumpcap03.nif] (Bug #34206)</li>
<li>Whiterun style interior beam had every conceivable material attached to it, except for the one it's actually made of. Should be all wood. [meshes\architecture\whiterun\wrinteriors\wrintbeamwall01.nif] (Bug #34208)</li>
<li>Another Whiterun style beam had collision data well outside the visible boundaries of the mesh. [meshes\architecture\whiterun\wrinteriors\wrintbeam768l.nif] (Bug #34213)</li>
<li>Whiterun castle part with incorrect materials. [meshes\architecture\whiterun\wrinteriors\wrcastle\wrintcastlestonecolumn01.nif] (Bug #34209)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Navmesh Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The river starting at -6.2 and extending west to cell -13,3 was missing numerous namvesh markers to indicate water. (Bug #33974)</li>
<li>Several navmesh issues have been corrected in Tovald's Cave. (Bug #34100)</li>
<li>Fixed NPCs getting stuck on walls in Forelhost Stronghold, as well as updated cover data. [Forelhost01] (Bug #34034)</li>
<li>Fixed bad navmesh in Driftshade Refuge, plus and out of place bench, [0003D5AC] (Bug #34150)</li>
<li>Navmesh inside Grosta's house at Heartwood Mill had one vertex next to the door that was VERY slightly floating. This was apparently enough to prevent her and Gralnach from exiting their house entirely at 7am when they're supposed to. (Bug #34017)</li>
<li>DLC1HunterValleyCave01 had a broken navmesh triangle on the ledge near the jump area.</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>ccBGSSSE001_DeleteOnQuestDone: Script unnecessarily calls to clear an alias that isn't optional and is already going to have been cleared because the quest is stopped anyway. (Bug #34113)</li>
<li>WICourierScript: The GiveItemsToPlayer function in WICourierScript has been modified so that the generic message will again be shown when the courier delivers items. Too many CC and VC offerings have set things up to use him but he has no dialogue to cover those generic cases. For PC users, if SKSE is installed and properly running, the generic message will only be shown if there are items remaining for him to give you after speaking to him. (Bug #34138)</li>
<li>DLC1_QF_DLC1WE06_01017867: Final stage fragment was not cleaning up the generated NPCs for aliases 4, 5, and 6. [NR] (Bug #34082)</li>
<li>magicAttachAshPileOnDeath: Missing a check for the MagicNoDistintegrate which can result in double ash piles for ghosts. (Bug #34033)</li>
<li>DLC1_TIF__0100D058: Script was not checking visibility on a map marker before adding it. (Bug #34018)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The extra dragon outside the south exit for Bleak Falls Barrow would leave behind a permanent corpse due to it not only being held in a quest alias, but also as a direct script property. This encounter was also originally mistaken for cut content but a thorough examination of all the components shows that it has always been a standard vanilla encounter. (Bug #15086)</li>
<li>Orgnar will incorrectly tell the player they are only the cook after Delphine has formally transferred ownership of the inn. [DialogueRiverwood_Revised -> Misc -> Hellos: 00045443, 00045444] (Bug #34079)</li>
<li>Further Study [ccBGSSSE001_Radiant_2] should not be setting the quest target to the alchemist while the objective is still telling the player to obtain the fish. Only objective 200 should be set to target them. (Bug #34066)</li>
<li>Heart of Gold [ccBGSSSE001_Misc_WhiterunPartOne] should not be setting the quest target to Mila Valentia until the player is supposed to bring the goldfish to her. (Bug #34114)</li>
<li>Two of a Kind [ccBGSSSE001_Misc_WhiterunPartTwo] should not be setting the quest target to Mila Valentia until the player is supposed to bring the goldfish to her. (Bug #34115)</li>
<li>Stocking Up [ccBGSSSE001_Radiant_1] should not be setting the quest target to the innkeeper while the objective is still telling the player to obtain the fish. Only objective 200 should be set to target them. (Bug #34140)</li>
<li>Further Study [ccBGSSSE001_Radiant_2] cannot pick Lami as a valid alchemist target because she was never added to the ccBGSSSE001_RadiantAlchemists formlist. She meets all of the quest's conditions. (Bug #34116)</li>
<li>Harralds relationship with the player does not improve after bringing him his sword. [FreeformRiften16, Stage 200] (Bug #33886)</li>
<li>Nerveshatter and the Sword of Jyggalag are not counted toward the achievement for collecting daedric artifacts. (Bug #34196)</li>
<li>Ring of Khajiit is not counted toward the achievement for collecting daedric artifacts. (Bug #34195)</li>
<li>Skeleton Key is not counted toward the achievement for collecting daedric artifacts. (Bug #34204)</li>
<li>Ahtar asks if the player is a sellsword even if he's already tasked you with going to kill bandits. A condition check on his Hello topic was missing. [Favor104] (Bug #33979)</li>
<li>During In My Time Of Need [MS08, MS08KematuStage175Branch], if you speak to Kematu you can be offered a topic that prompts "Why are you after Saadia?". This option is incorrectly assigned to him when it should instead be assigned to the 2 Redguards you initially meet if you tell them you know where to find Saadia. (Bug #33868)</li>
<li>Caught in the Rain requires that the player read Swims-In-Deep-Water's note before being able to fish for his lucky hat. However, the quest enables the objective and target marker for the fishing spot where the hat is before doing so. This misleads the player into thinking the note is optional, but the progression of the quest requires reading it. To fix this, the objective for fishing up the hat will not be displayed until after the note is read. [ccBGSSSE001_Fish_MQ2, Stage 10, objective call moved to stage 20] (Bug #34201)</li>
<li>At the beginning of Blood's Honor, you can mention to Kodlak that he wanted to see you, but this would not be knowledge the player has until speaking to Aela first. This is due to an incorrect condition check on the dialogue. [C04] (Bug #33862)</li>
<li>During The Temple of Miraak, Freya can be asked what the Tree Stone is. There is an unnecessary restriction on the topic preventing it from being accessible in an interior. [DLC2MQ02, DLC2MQ02FreaTreeStoneTopic] (Bug #32557)</li>
<li>The side quest at Frostflow Abyss will break if you pick the lock on the basement door before you've been given the notification that the quest is active. The door will now require the key in order to proceed so that the quest doesn't completely break. (Bug #33120) [NR]</li>
<li>Missing in Action [MS09] should no longer set off trespass warnings when entering Fralia's house. A trigger box outside the home has been added which will enable the public flag on the cell and unlock both doors so you don't have to pick them either. (Bug #21367)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>0800097D: Trigger box for Kinthal's Saints bandit camp tries to disable itself even though it's controlled by an enable parent. Removed the DisableWhenDone flag as it's also flagged DoOnce and won't trigger again anyway. (Bug #34098)</li>
<li>080AF353: Trigger box for Kinthal's Saints bandit camp at Bronze Water Cave tries to disable itself even though it's controlled by an enable parent. Removed the DisableWhenDone flag as it's also flagged DoOnce and won't trigger again anyway. (Bug #34097)</li>
<li>000E3EAE: Added script to this arrow to disable it once Leifnarr's corpse has been deleted. (Bug #34062)</li>
<li>Several references which were out of place have been corrected. Mostly lanterns. (Bug #33917)</li>
<li>000AAC31, 0004DE1C, 00050fde, 0004f43C, 000c1ea2: Bushes either buried too deep in the ground or floating above it. (Bug #34090)</li>

<li>000D59C4, 000E31B7, 00082A20: 3 refs previously addressed in the patch have been redone in a more proper manner. (Bug #34051)</li>
<li>0007DDC7, 0007DDF0: Misplaced walls in Elenwyn's Solar. Accompanying bench and cabinet (with objects) have been adjusted to match. (Bug #34020)</li>
<li>Another batch of placed references corrected. (Bug #34014)</li>
<li>00029E40, 00029E51: Misaligned rock and tree near Anise's Cabin. (Bug #34001)</li>
<li>07000900, 07000901: Rocks added to cover a gap. (Bug #34000)</li>
<li>Another batch of various placed reference fixes. (Bug #34000)</li>

<li>00030038: Walls in Dragonsreach with a small gap. (Bug #33997)</li>
<li>00087792: Changed trigger property DisableWhenDone to false to prevent the trigger from throwing errors due to it having an enable parent that controls its state. (Bug #29459)</li>
<li>000832c3, 000832c4, 000832c5, 000832c6: Barrels in the player's designated quarters at the College of Winterhold that should not be respawning containers. (Bug #33822)</li>
<li>0002e526: Volendrung is likely to fall off of its initial display area because it needs the DefaultHavokOnload() script attached. (Bug #33861)</li>
<li>000FED31, 000FED33, 000FED34, 000FED37, 000FED39, 000FED3B, 000FED40, 000FED41: Food crates with incorrect ownership applied. (Bug #33963)</li>
<li>Several references at Anise's Cabin do not have proper ownership or respawn data on them. (Bug #33972, 33973)</li>
<li>00106876, 001068B4: Campfire and snowdrift floating at Stendarr's Beacon. (Bug #33980)</li>
<li>001068AD, 001068AE, 001068AF: 3 NPCs at Stendarr's Beacon that lacked persist locations. (Bug #33980)</li>

<b><u>USSEP Fixes</u></b>

<b><u>Actor and AI Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Breton, Dunmer, and Dremora races were not flagged for advanced avoidance like other NPC races.

<b><u>USSEP Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>A mountain just outside of Falkreath was accidentally deleted and has been restored [000607f3] (Bug #33676).</li>
<li>3 meshes (2 from 4.3.0, one from an older ticket) had editor markers which were being rendered on XBox due to a continuing bug in the XBox rendering code. The hidden flag workaround has been applied now.

<b><u>Official 1.6.1130 Patch Update Reconciliation</u></b>

<li>dunCragslaneLvlBanditGuard had its activation name changed from a blank spot to "Bouncer". This modifies our fix in Bug #12481 where the USSEP had it labeled "Bandit" instead.</li>
<li>An undocumented USSEP fix for WEServicesHunterFaction not having a vendor chest set has been fixed in Patch 1.6.1130. Therefore our added container for this fix will be removed as it is no longer needed [USKPWEServicesHunterFactionContainer].</li>
<li>FarmhouseWindMillWR activation text removed.</li>
<li>EnchArmorIronBandedCuirassRestoration02 fix was duplicated officially.</li>
<li>2 hay bales in Nchuand-Zel Control had their positions corrected.</li>
<li>Argonian Assemblage roof tile position has been corrected.</li>
<li>Dwemer Scrap Metal can be sold in shops now.</li>
<li>Merged changes to the Matching Set perk for light armor due to the addition of a new Orcish Light set.</li>
<li>Merged changes to the Matching Set perk for heavy armor.</li>
<li>Several daggers and other weapons had their sound data and critical hit values corrected.</li>
<li>The stray collision plane outside of Windhelm was deleted.</li>
<li>Kindred Judgment being blocked because the Death Hounds are dead has been fixed officially.</li>

<b><u>USSEP Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>When addressing the Thieves Guild master trainers in 32449, some of the responses were overlooked while being patched and led to an inconsistent response state when talking to Vipir or Niruin about Archery or Pickpocketing. (Bug #33058)</li>
<li><s>When Redbelly Mine was fixed, its ebony nodes were relocated to Northwind Mine. This has now been updated to instead relocate them to a new small cave just to the east of Shor's Stone. The cave houses the Ebony nodes and a small pack of wolves, nothing more. (Bug #33087)</s> [USSEP 4.3.3]</li>
<li>The Skyforge Dagger tempering recipe was erroneously removed in the USSEP 4.2.9 update. It has been restored since the one in the Fishing DLC is actually for Nord Hero Daggers. (Bug #32957)</li>
<li>All included .psc files for Papyrus have been relocated to Data\Source\Scripts which complies with the default configuration of the SSE CK. This should have been done ages ago. [Affects PC Only - Does not affect the game, only the CK]</li>

(Bug #33109)</li>
<li>StockadeScaffoldStairs01 incorrectly had alternate textures applying snow to them despite this static never being used in snowy areas. The game uses StockadeScaffoldStairs01Light_SN for those instances. (Bug #32885)</li>
<li>Daggers added by Fishing and Saints & Seducers were not able to be given as gifts to adopted children because the daggers were never added to the relevant formlists. (Bug #33100)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Riften Fishery was not flagged as a public location, which leads to trespassing crimes. This location is required to be accessible to do any of the quests from the Fishing DLC. (Bug #32993)</li>
<li>Drunken Huntsman and Belethor's General Goods both had incorrect world location markers set. Each one was referencing the other's marker, which can lead to incorrect location information being relayed to the player. (Bug #33597)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Magic, Perk and Skill Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>FoodFortifyMagicka is missing the MagicAlchRestoreMagicka keyword. (Bug #32976)</li>
<li>ccBGSSSE037_NightEyeEffect erroneously included a dispel keyword for MagicAlchBeneficial which caused unrelated beneficial effects to get removed when a potion of Night Eye is consumed. (Bug #32974)</li>
<li>ReanimateFFTargetActor0, ReanimateFFTargetActor50, and ReanimateFFAimed50 lack the WISpellDangerous keyword which the other levels of reanimation have. (Bug #33300)</li>

</ul>

<b><u>Mesh and Texture Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>It was not possible to harvest Creep Cluster in a garden planter because the soil object had a set of invalid invisible collision walls around it for some reason. These were not present on the same mesh in Skyrim LE, so those walls were deleted from the mesh and the remaining collision layer aligned more evenly with the visible dirt object. [meshes\_byoh\clutter\house crafting\soil01.nif] (Bug #21364)</li>
<li>Deer skull props had too large a collision radius, resulting in them floating above objects. [meshes\clutter\bones\deerskullprop.nif] (Bug #33020)</li>

<li>The cage key for the animal pens in Faldar's Tooth is never added anywhere despite being set up for use in dunFaldarsToothQST. It has been added to the alias inventory on the Boss NPC. (Bug #33009) [NR]</li>
<li>In The Jagged Crown [CW02A,CW02B] if you originally escaped Helgen with Ralof, but side with the Imperials, Hadvar is never enabled even though he's supposed to be. Similarly if you escaped Helgen with Hadvar but joined the Stormcloaks, Ralof is never enabled. Both characters have lines assigned for switching sides, and their aliases in each quest will not fill which will have lasting effects on their future relationships with the player. Their aliases both neglected to check the "Allow Disabled" box, which broke the intended interactions in Stage 30. Due to the complexities involved, it will not be possible to entirely reverse the issues caused by this if you are already past this point in the game. (Bug #33002) [Partially NR]</li>
<li>In Bleak Falls Barrow [MQ103] Delphine's scene dialogue with Farengar overlaps when she points out he has a visitor. This causes Farengar's line to be truncated and his next one to begin, creating an awkward transition. (Bug #33190)</li>

<li>USKP 1.2.1 was supposed to do a check for Blood on the Ice [MS11] to enable an alternate key to Hjerim if Tova was dead but the quest was already somehow running.

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Returning to High Gate Ruins after you've completed it the first time will result in being blocked at the first floor puzzle if you've been away longer than the 30 day reset timer. A bypass trigger has been put into place to open the grate if the dungeon's original quest has progressed past this point. This should open the way even if the controlling puzzle has reset itself.

<li>At certain camera angles, the occlusion bounds in the Aetherium Forge will cause most of the cell to stop rendering. (Bug #32790)</li>
<li>Several interior cells marked as wood acoustic spaces should in fact have been stone acoustic spaces. (Bug #32634)</li>
<li>Dawnstar Barracks location should not have been tagged with LocTypeHouse since it's not an NPCs actual home. (Bug #32627)</li>
<li>Lod's House should not be marked with LocTypeFarm since this is a leftover flag from a quest that was cut before Bethesda turned him into the town Blacksmith. (Bug #32625)</li>
<li>Landscape edits made in Dawnguard.esm to support the Gallows Hall DLC were blocked by Hearthfires.esm. This data has now been forwarded up into the USSEP so that the intended changes will actually show up in game. (Bug #32577)</li>
<li>Brandy-Mug Farm, Hlaalu Farm, and Hollyfrost Farm were set as owned by individual NPCs instead of the appropriate factions. This could cause unwanted trespass crimes to be attached to the other NPCs who share those locations. (Bug #32446)</li>

<li>Impassable navmesh section in cell -2, -14 due to a disconnected triangle edge. Also a missing segment of the border on the north side of the same cell. [North shore of Lake Ilinalta] (Bug #32692)</li>
<li>The entry point to Ruunvald is not connected to a navmesh, which results in followers being unable to use the door. (Bug #32657)</li>
<li>Disconnected navmesh edge inside the Vilemyr Inn next to the bar. (Bug #32644)</li>
<li>Some minor adjustments have been made to the navmesh and precut markers around Lakeview that should make it easier for NPCs to walk around the area before any house parts get built. (Bug #32616)</li>
<li>Navmesh at the Riften Imperial Camp was allowing NPCs to clip into the map tent. (Bug #32585)</li>
<li>Corrected navmesh triangle linkage in Fort Greymoor Prison, Fort Sungard, and two wilderness cells. (Bug #32544)</li>

<li>One triangle at Katla's Farm was incorrectly marked as water and preferred. (Bug #32453)</li>

<li>Navmeshes in and around the north side of Morthal had several defects that needed to be resolved. (Bug #32836)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>It is possible for the Courier to become stuck at a delivery location under certain conditions due to how the location checks work. When this happens he won't deliver anything else because the quest is stuck in a bad state. (Bug #32768)</li>
<li>Rubbish Retrieval [ccBGSSSE001_Radiant_3] can apparently only pull from 2 of the expected 4 location choices because the activator references are not persistent. (Bug #32669)</li>
<li>In A Few Words with You [Favor013], Roggi Knot-Beard's branch of the quest incorrectly links back to the speech check dialogue options if you had already returned his shield to him and become his friend. (Bug #32630)</li>
<li>Ancarion was being removed from his services faction after A New Source of Stalhrim [DLC2SV02] because DLC2SV02 incorrectly set his alias up as being in the faction, so when DLC2SV02AncarionMerchant started, the faction setting on that alias canceled the first one out. (Bug #32580)</li>
<li>Klepper and Frabbi should not be giving out rumors about the Hall of the Dead being closed if they've already mentioned it, or the player has already received the quest from Brother Valerus. (Bug #32522)</li>
<li>Several greeting topics in the Thieves Guild were inaccessible due to toggling a check variable too soon. [QF_TG02B_00084ABD] (Bug #32449)</li>
<li>Several issues that remained with A Night To Remember [DA14] have been resolved for both dialogue and AI package conditions. (Bug #32447)</li>
<li>The Riften Thane quest does not award a reputation of 3 like the other Thane quests do. (Bug #31736) [NR]</li>
<li>The Dwemer spider ambush outside of Bronze Water Cave can be set off prematurely due to the spiders not actually being disabled prior to Beneath Bronze Waters [ccBGSSSE001_Misc_Dwarven]. If set off prematurely, the quest will then be impossible to start because the spiders are required for the quest. (Bug #32944)</li>
<li>It is possible for Bandit Bounty [BQ01] to choose Nilheim after Telrav's Request [dunNilheimQST] which will then break it because Nilheim is a NoReset zone. If you've completed dunNilheimQST then that location will be locked out from selection. (Bug #32948)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>defaultDisplayItemInListScript: Added an OnCellAttach() event to fix items which fall off of display racks. (Bug #32655)</li>
<li>DialogueFollowerScript: Animal followers are not properly unmarked as a player teammate when dismissed. (Bug #32499)</li>
<li>CWMapActivatorScript: Map flags might not get placed because OnCellAttach() doesn't always mean the 3D is loaded. The PlaceFlags() call is now in an OnLoad() event. (Bug #22948)</li>
<li>dunLabyrinthianMazeControlScript: It is possible for the Dremora holding the Diadem of the Savant to fail to be teleported back out of Shalidor's Maze when the player solves it. If this happens, the Diadem is unobtainable. A copy will now be generated should this fail to work as expected. [Note: This fix was actually done in March of 2016 but was undocumented for some reason] (Bug #32943)</li>
<li>TrapSwingingWall: Insufficient safeguards against infinite loops in the processing for entering or leaving the cell when one of the associated traps is set off. (Bug #32947)</li>
<li>DLC2TrapApoTentacle: Script could attempt to process calls for animations before the 3D state has finished loading because it's parent script relies on OnCellAttach events. (Bug #32928)</li>

<li>000D6C07, 000D6C08, 000D6C09, 000D6C0D, 000D6C0E, 000D6C0F: Duplicated weapon rack setups in Northwatch Keep. (Bug #32642)</li>
<li>Viriya and Swims-In-Deep-Water did not have Persist Locations specified, which would severely restrict their AI package processing. (Bug #32560)</li>

<li>Vagrant Boots were given incorrect keywords setting them up as light armor. This does not match the rest of the items in the Vagrant set which are all set up as foot clothing. (Bug #32478)</li>
<li>POIYisraBurnt should not have been set up as a respawning container. (Bug #32535)</li>
<li>Vacant bee hives did not have the correct pickup sound attached. (Bug #32537)</li>
<li>Potions created at the Alchemy Table all incorrectly had the use sound for poisons because DefaultPotion had the wrong sound data. (Bug #32532)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>DragonBridgeExterior03 (the south side of the town containing the bridge) was erroneously set up as being in DragonBridgeFarmLocation, which is the house location for the Lylvieve Family House. It should have instead been assigned to the main DragonBridgeLocation. Related to this, the Lylvieve Family House should not have anything more than the LocTypeHouse and LocTypeDwelling keywords on it since it should be inheriting that from its parent location. It appears that at one point there was to be a separate farm location from the main town but those plans were scrubbed and the keywords and location assignments weren't cleaned up properly. (Bug #32476)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Navmesh Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The entry way from the Soul Cairn into the Boneyard was missing finalization on the navmesh under the door which could result in NPCs being unable to follow the player through. (Bug #32525)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>dunDeadMensRespiteSealedDoor: The message shown to the player in Dead Men's Respite was being displayed regardless of which actor was actually trying to open the door. (Bug #32533)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Scare My Enemy (WIAssault02) incorrectly paid out rewards even if the player killed the target (not what the NPC asked for) or if they refused the quest (obviously shouldn't do that). (Bug #32547)</li>
<li>The Augur of Dunlain will not speak his expected lines if you go to the Midden before asking where he is. This is due to a set of bad conditions on the quest script. (Bug #31794)</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v4.2.7 (2022-06-18) [SSE 1.6.353]</p>
<b><u>USSEP Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>We have received official confirmation from BGS that the Twin Souls perk was not intended to let you summon two Ash Spawns at once. Our previous edit for this purpose has been removed. This reverts Bug #16819.</li>
<li>We also had contact with another developer who implied the existence of an internal style guide and provided guidance on a number of capitalization issues when we asked them about it. Numerous entries (~2000 in all, going back several versions) have either been removed, revised, or added based on this guidance. There may be some that have been missed. If this is the case, please report these issues to our bug tracker for correction.</li>
<li>The fix for Carlotta and Mila talking about closing the shop early was incorrectly implemented and caused the scene to fail entirely. This has now been corrected and they will execute the scene as expected. (Bug #32422) [This effectively reverts the original issue #9959]</li>
<li>An old fix from the early days in 2012 that was intended to make the speech checks at the Whiterun gates fully functional has been repealed. Half of the modified check was redundant because the game would pass it anyway, and the other half had no appropriate response for a failure. This reverts Bug #10408.</li>
<li>Two beds were added to Ironback Hideout, but this change is not documented anywhere in old changelogs or on our bug tracker so they have now been removed since neither of them is getting used by the bandits anyway. (Bug #32358)</li>
<li>In the first release of SE 1.6, Bethesda had set many of the arrow records to have 0.1 weight, and we merged those changes. They have since undone this and returned those records back to having 0 weight, so these changes have been reversed in the patch as well. (Bug #32309)</li>
<li>An old fix for the script that controls setting up Purity [CR13, CR13QuestScript] did not correctly process the parent script setup if the player had no Glenmoril Witch heads available, but there were still some left to collect. This would then cause the quest to be running in a bad state due to not being properly registered in the Companions radiant quest system. (Bug #32426)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Merged Fixes from Garthand's Unofficial Creation Club Content Patches</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The following fixes have been imported from Garthand's patches:
 <ul><br /><u>Survival Mode</u><br /><br />
   <li>Corrected Spiced Beef effect to restore stamina to reflect a change made in Survival.</li>
   <li>Some elemental fury effects had a time of 0 seconds instead of 15 seconds as intended.</li>
   <li>Complete rewrite of elemental fury conditions to make them more maintainable as Bethesda adds new weapon speed modifying effects to the game.</li>
   <li>Bound arrows have a hardcoded weight of 0.1 each in Survival, even though no other bound weapons have weight. To account for this, bound bow will now increase the player's maximum carry weight by 10 when active to account for the weight of the 100 bound arrows.</li>
   <li>Sleeping at a campsite from the Camping Creation Club item will no longer leave the player Drained when using Survival.</li>
   <li>Flin, Sujamma, Shein and Mazte were missing hunger keywords.</li>
   <li>The Mara's Wrath spell introduced in Arcane Accessories will now protect the user from freezing water as the description indicates.</li>
   <li>The resist freezing water side effect of some spells would show duplicate descriptions when the spell was recast, despite only being applied once/</li>
   <li>Added large restore hunger keyword to meat pie. [USKP added pie record]</li>
   <li>Peckish, hungry, famished and starving debuffs were incorrectly reducing melee weapon speed by more than the specified 30/40% when only the first Dual Flurry perk was unlocked.</li>
   <li>Peckish, hungry, famished and starving debuffs were incorrectly increasing ranged weapon speed when the quickdraw perk was active.</li>
   <li>Brown Rot, Greenspore and Gutworm can no longer be absorbed or reflected, making them function similarly to other diseases.</li>
   <li>Brown Rot, Greenspore and Gutworm now account for the player's disease resistance before being applied. Players with 100% resistance, (including werewolves and vampires) will no longer become infected.</li>
   <li>Amended the Steed Stone description to account for effects both when Survival is enabled and disabled using the same wording found in Survival's Extra Pockets perk description.</li>
   <li>Added the VendorItemFood keyword to foods added by survival to be consistent with other foods (Cabbage Potato Soup, Potato Soup, Tomato Soup, Vegetable Soup, Horker Ash Yam Stew, Apple Cabbage Stew, Beef Stew, Horker Stew, Venison Stew, Clam Chowder, Elsweyr Fondue)</li>
   <li>Applied No Absorb/Reflect flag to advanced stage Survival diseases to prevent them from failing to update when the player has an absorb magic rating.</li>
   <li>Added the Survival_BodyandHead to the following robes to make them consistent with other robes: DLC2DarkElfOutfitRed, DLC2DarkElfOutfitBlue, DLC2DarkElfOutfit, ClothesMythicDawnRobes.</li>
 </ul>
 <ul><br /><u>Rare Curios</u><br /><br />
   <li>Added werebears to the list of creatures affected by silver bolts.</li>
   <li>Corkbulb, iron, silver, orcish and bonemold bolts were missing their pick up and put down sounds.</li>
   <li>Silver bolt mesh fix added to prevent egregious clipping, as this bolt's mesh had a different rotation value than any other bolt.</li>
 </ul>
 <ul><br /><u>Saints & Seducers</u><br /><br />
   <li>Could not decapitate NPCs wearing madness helmets due to a bad mesh setting. (meshes\creationclub\bgssse025\armor\madness\madnesshelmf_0.nif, meshes\creationclub\bgssse025\armor\madness\madnesshelmf_1.nif, meshes\creationclub\bgssse025\armor\madness\madnesshelmm_0.nif, meshes\creationclub\bgssse025\armor\madness\madnesshelmm_1.nif)</li>
   <li>Corrected crafting recipe for amber war axe to be consistent with other war axe recipes (should never be cheaper than an equivalent sword)</li>
   <li>Madness Helmet of Recovery and Staada's helmet couldn't be tempered.</li>
   <li>Golden, dark, amber and madness daggers weren't using the correct draw and sheathe sounds.</li>
   <li>The summoning spells did not have the no absorb/reflect flag and so could be absorbed when the player attempted to cast them.</li>
   <li>Swing speed on greatswords added by this creation have been increased to .75 to match the USSEP greatsword speed changes.</li>
   <li>Nerveshatter could produce a Papyrus error if the player grabbed it before it completed teleporting in.</li>
   <li>Placed insects would immediately despawn due to the insect critter scripts; these have been replaced with insect spawners which spawn a single insect of the intended variety.</li>
   <li>Placed additional critter landing markers inside of the Solitude Sewers so that butterflies and blissbugs won't immediately despawn from an inability to find anywhere to land.</li>
   <li>It was possible to choose to give Staada the Sheogorath-shaped amber without having it on your person.</li>
   <li>It was possible to exit Staada's dialogue early to obtain multiple helmets.</li>
   <li>The insect companions should no longer be able to escape from their cages.</li>
   <li>Fixed an improperly defined quest alias that would prevent Restoring Order from beginning correctly.</li>
   <li>Removed a missing script from the Solitude manhole activator, as it will only generate errors without the script present.</li>
   <li>Removed a missing script from Staada's return AI package, as it will only generate errors without the script present.</li>
   <li>A number of barricades were producing Papyrus errors because they were not linked to their collision markers as their scripts expected. This also caused the collision markers to persist even after the barricades were destroyed.</li>
   <li>The purple moth near the Solitude Sewers entrance could not be disabled by the game's critter script because it had an enable parent.</li>
   <li>A triggerbox had conflicting enable settings which prevented it from disabling after execution as intended.</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Actor and AI Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>It was possible for Temba Wide-Arm to become stuck inside the inn in Ivarstead because her sandbox packages at the local sawmill had no specific times set. She has now been given a setup like other sawmill operators, and her work packages moved to the top of her package stack so they will be processed properly. (Bug #29139)</li>
<li>ChaurusFaction and dunBlackreachFalmerServantFaction were not correctly set as friendly which would cause the Falmer thralls to attack the chaurus. (Bug #31774)</li>
<li>EncAlikr03Melee2HBerserkRedguardM01 had the invulnerable flag set when they should not have. (Bug #31718)</li>
<li>Mila Valentia has an AI package that targets her mother, Carlotta. It's possible for Carlotta to be killed. This can result in Mila disappearing from the game once Carlotta's corpse is removed to the body cleanup cell. It could also potentially lead to a CTD once that corpse is later culled by the engine. Mila's package will now target the marker at the Bannered Mare since the package would have sent both of them to the inn anyway. (Bug #32455)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li><s>DraugrWarAxeHoned had an incorrect stagger value of 0, when it should have been set to 0.85 to match the "ancient" version of the same weapon. (Bug #32412)</s> [Official Patch 1.6.1130]</li>
<li><s>EnchArmorIronBandedCuirassRestoration02 should have had a base value of 200 set instead of 299 (01 and 03 variants do, typo in the data set) (Bug #32388)</s> [Official Patch 1.6.1130]</li>
<li>The shock spider activator object [DLC2ExpSpiderShockBombENEMY] is using the wrong script property to handle the explosion. The "friendly" version of this correctly uses the 6 properties meant for shock spider bombs, so the enemy one is now set to the same. (Bug #32383)</li>
<li>ccBGSSSE001_FishGuide1, ccBGSSSE001_FishGuide2, ccBGSSSE001_FishGuide3, ccBGSSSE001_FishGuide4: Books with the wrong pick-up sound. (Bug #32331)</li>
<li>MQ202GissurNote, MS07JareeRaNote, MS06FalkFirebeardNote: Notes with missing object bounds. (Bug #32324)</li>
<li>Fish display plaques in Windstad Manor, Heljarchen Hall, and Proudspire Manor have all been incorrectly set to use the aliases for the plaques located in Lakeview Manor. This results in all fish being put on displays, regardless of which house you're in, being attached to the plaques in Lakeview Manor. In order to correct this, the retroactive update script for USSEP 4.2.7 will first take down any fish that are occupying these aliases and return them to the player. Then the aliases on each of the broken rack controllers will be updated to point to the right references. When this process completes, if any fish you had needed to be removed, you will be informed by the patch when your save is loaded. This is a one time check that only needs to be performed on existing saves. New games will already have all of this data set from the start. (Bug #32450)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Mesh and Texture Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Guards could be seen slowly sliding along the Dragonsreach bridge. (meshes\architecture\whiterun\wrbuildings\wrcastlebridge01.nif) (Bug #29305)</li>
<li>Corrupted texture path to the normal map on sea kelp. (meshes\landscape\grass\waterkelptall01.nif) (Bug #32392)</li>
<li>Texture sets ccBGSSSE001_WeaponNordHeroDaggerTS, ccBGSSSE001_WeaponNordHeroMaceTS, and ccBGSSSE001_WeaponNordHeroWarhammerTS all incorrectly placed the cube maps in the Envoronment Mask slot when they should be in the Environment slot.</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Navmesh Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The navmesh on the exterior door into Wolfskull Cave was missing a door portal. This causes NPCs to be unable to enter the dungeon at all. (Bug #32079)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>When a guard extorts you for 50 gold after dropping and picking up a weapon in front of them, the dialogue will work even if you do not actually have 50 gold on you. The script, however, will still deduct 50 gold from the player which can lead to integer underflow issues on the player's gold amount. (Bug #29026)</li>
<li>J'zargo would comment on being at Saarthal when he wasn't actually there, unlike the other NPCs at the location. (Bug #31750)</li>
<li>At the end of the quest to get the Elytra pet for Mania, the dialogue to accept it as a follower is incorrectly checking for Stage 50 in the quest for the Dementia version - this stage doesn't exist, and isn't the right quest to check either. It should be checking for Stage 25 on the Mania quest. (Bug #32396)</li>
<li>During Mourning Never Comes [DB03] Alain Dufont's initial dialogue cuts off before the player is allowed to give a response and he enters combat before he's supposed to. It was incorrectly set as a goodbye response, and the script should not have been added to it. (Bug #31835)</li>
<li>Eimar has some lines that make no sense for him to use while he's at the Bannered Mare. One wasn't conditioned to the location he's in, the other was using an incorrect function to check if TG03 was completed or not. (Bug #29462)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>WordWallTriggerBleakFallsScript: The "Done" state of the script was not disabling the chanting trigger as is done in the more generic WordWallTrigger02Script. Bleak Falls Barrow and Shearpoint both use this script and should no longer restart the chanting when visited after learning their words. (Bug #31773)</li>
<li>PlayerVampireQuestScript: Becoming a vampire never calls for a cure of any DLC added diseases. Added bonus of correcting this also means any mod-added diseases will be cured as well, just like Lycanthropy. (Bug #32361)</li>
<li>ccBGSSSE001_CritterSpawn: Fish spawns needed to be brought in sync with the fixes in the vanilla script this parallels. (Bug #32385)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>03018b89: Trigger box adjusted to focus more narrowly on the doorway in front of Vlindrel Hall due to unwanted object checks. (Bug #32433)</li>
<li>0005776C: Rock cliff lowered with an exposed underside. A critter landing marker (Ref 00070D0B) was lowered along with it. (Bug #31704)</li>
<li>0010D099: Cooking pot not hanging properly off of spit. (Bug #31705)</li>
<li>000FCDAB: Misplaced iron ingot. (Bug #31708)</li>

<li>0005BFB1, 0005BFB3, 0005BFB5: Misplaced seared slaughterfish pieces. (Bug #32291)</li>
<li>000769A2, 000769A3: Closed a gap between dirt mounds. (Bug #31754)</li>
<li>000A6D9F: Column with small gap rotated to close it. (Bug #32413)</li>
<li>000af529: Xander's initial location is outside the playable area of the Red Wave which could result in him falling forever and causing a game crash.</li>
<li>000DE951, 000DE976, 000DE977, 000DE978, 000DE97B: Beds aboard the Red Wave which were owned by the wrong faction. This prevented 5 of the pirates from being able to sleep, even though they'd go and stand next to the beds when they were supposed to be. (Bug #31767)</li>
<li>000847f9: Idle marker owned by Carlotta that should have been owned by her faction so Mila can use it when sandboxing at the market stall.</li>
<li>0300B870: Hay pile that is not properly disabled before the room it's in is built. (Bug #32381)</li>

<b><u>USSEP Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The sound file splice for the response to "Your weapons and armor are impressive" was missing from the BSA archive. (Bug #31680)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Actor and AI Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>LvlBanditAmbushMissile was set to use csDraugrMeleeLvl1 instead of csHumanMissile. They are derived from bandit templates, not draugr templates. (Bug #31655)</li>
<li>LvlBanditAmbushMeleeNordM was incorrectly set to inherit scripts from its template, which blocks the attached ambush script from being used. (Bug #31656)</li>
<li>LvlFalmerAmbushMissile was set to use csFalmerMelee1H instead of csFalmerMissile. (Bug #31653)</li>
<li>EncDraugr05TemplateMissile was incorrectly set to use 1-Handed weapons instead of bows. (Bug #31638)</li>
<li>EncWarlockAtro06ImperialM is incorrectly set to inherit from the Pyromancer template instead of the Conjurer template. (Bug #31635)</li>
<li>dunRobbersGorge_LvlBanditBoss, dunRobbersGorge_LvlBanditGuard, dunRobbersGorge_LvlBanditMeleeAny, dunRobbersGorge_LvlBanditMeleeBerserker, dunRobbersGorge_LvlBanditMeleeTank, dunRobbersGorge_LvlBanditMissile, dunRobbersGorge_LvlBanditSentry, and dunRobbersGorge_LvlBanditWizard were all erroneously left as members of the standard Bandit faction which would make it impossible to pay the Robber's Gorge bridge toll or to walk away from the camp unharmed. They are all members of a quest specific bandit faction which is only made hostile if the player refuses to pay the toll or otherwise attempts to pass through the camp without paying. (Bug #31571) [NR]</li>
<li>Leveled bandit ghosts incorrectly dropped physical loot despite being otherwise setup to be ghosts who shouldn't do that. (Bug #31769)</li>
<li>DLC2EncBandit03MissileDarkElf02F was incorrectly configured to spawn from generic melee NPCs instead of archers. (Bug #31684)</li>
<li>EncForsworn03TemplateBossMagic was incorrectly configured as a melee class instead of a shaman class. (Bug #31682)</li>
<li>Serana should no longer make use of Skyforge objects while Kodlak's funeral scene is underway. Her AI package will disable sandbox behavior until you retrieve the Wuuthrad fragment from Kodlak's room after Eorlund asks you to go get it. (Bug #31572)</li>
<li>Kodlak's corpse should no longer be naked while on the funeral pyre. (Bug #31572)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Staff of the Flame Atronach and Staff of the Frost Atronach were both erroneously set as Destruction staves when they're supposed to be Conjuration staves. They have both been separated from their templates in order to address this. [DLC1StaffFalmerConjureFlameAtronach, DLC1StaffFalmerConjureFrostAtronach] (Bug #31435)</li>
<li>DLC2LItemEnchWeaponMaceBest should not have been flagged to calculate from all levels since it's intended to give you the best possible item it can. (Bug #31296)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Magic, Perk and Skill Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The right handed version of Revenant used by NPCs is incorrectly set to use the left hand. [RevenantRighHand] (Bug #31640)</li>
<li>AbFXAtronachStorm should not have the fire trail for Flame Atronachs attached to it. (Bug #31333)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Navmesh Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>It is apparently sometimes possible for NPCs to come out the Midden exit at the bottom of the main College spire, and when they do, they become trapped there because there is no ground path back into the area. Several navmeshes outside the area have now been adjusted to provide a walking path back up to the College. It's a somewhat roundabout path back, but it'll have to do. (Bug #30532)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Orgnar should no longer mention the love triangle in Riverwood if the triangle has been resolved. (Bug #31662)</li>
<li>During Season Unending (MQ302) the town that's part of the Stormcloak demand for compensation should have been set to Anga'a Mill instead of Darkwater Crossing because Darkwater Crossing has no dialogue selection set up for it, and the control quest that holds the other aliases also specifies Anga's Mill but never fills it. (Bug #31617)</li>
<li>The trigger box in Volunruud (0008af30) is not large enough and will not trigger properly if you enter the dungeon with followers. It has been expanded to cover the entire entry hall instead of only a very small sliver of it. (Bug #31588)</li>
<li>Aval Atheron should not be delivering lines about his selection of fruits and vegetables when his inventory in his vendor chest is nothing but meats - and his vendor list was corrected to reflect this in an earlier patched issue. (Bug #31564)</li>
<li>The Staff of Magnus [MG07] will not start if either Arniel Gane or Faralda are not available (killed, disabled, etc). Their parts in this quest are optional so their aliases have been marked to indicate this. The same issue will also prevent The Eye of Magnus [MG08] from starting as well. Since Bethesda saw fit to mark them this way for MG05, which happens immediately before these, they should have used the same solution here but didn't. (Bug #31681)</li>
<li>Geldis Sadri should no longer give rumors about investigating Thirsk Meadhall if the player has already been there and resolved it in favor of either the Nords or the Reiklings. (Bug #31349)</li>
<li>Runil's line "The number of graves in this cemetery never decreases." has an invalid condition on it which has been removed. He will now speak it as one of his random Hellos. (Bug #31338)</li>
<li>DLC1TolanHello2: Quest condition needed to be modified to check stage 10 instead of 8. (Bug #30313)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>DLC01WESC03Script: A typo in the OnCellDetach event prevented the associated encounter quest from stopping, which over time would lead to several of the encounters being scattered across the map that are never cleaned up. (Bug #31503)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>0010FB68: Rapids effect on the Morthal water wheel was backward. (Bug #31329)</li>
<li>0008493F, 00084940, 00084941: Prey animal spawn points that were partially or completely embedded into the landscape. This could cause the nearby predators linked to them to run down the trail into Dawnstar instead of staying near the temple. (Bug #31330)</li>
<li>05019D00: Rock placed to cover a gap in a cave wall. (Bug #31385)</li>
<li>00105A1A, 00105A1B: Misplaced mudcrab spawn markers. (Bug #31451)</li>

<li>000D979A, 000DC438: Clipping benches. (Bug #31495, Bug #31460)</li>
<li>000D97BB: Misplaced spigot. (Bug #31495)</li>
<li>000D97D7: Misplaced coin purse. (Bug #31495)</li>

<b><u>USSEP Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The topic type on DialogueFalkreath somehow got changed to "TimeToGo" rather than "Hello" which caused all of the NPCs in Falkreath with intro lines to fail to run them. (Bug #31409)</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v4.2.5 (2021-05-22) [SSE 1.5.97]</p>
<b><u>USSEP Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Updated the list of Wrye Bash Tags. The list is too long to fit in the file description now so a new file has been created, which will install to "Data\BashTags\Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.txt". Wrye Bash will use this file to determine the tags to use when building the Bashed Patch.</li>
<li>The Mage Gloves added by the USKP lacked proper first person meshes. These have now been created and the weight sliders for male and female have been set. (meshes\uskp\clothes\mages\1stpersonmageglovesf_0.nif, meshes\uskp\clothes\mages\1stpersonmageglovesf_1.nif, meshes\uskp\clothes\mages\1stpersonmageglovesm_0.nif, meshes\uskp\clothes\mages\1stpersonmageglovesm_1.nif) (Bug #29504)</li>
<li>The Throw Voice shout fix done on Bug #19544 somehow had its dialogue ordering messed up which appears to have blocked our generic fix for the races Bethesda didn't give the recorded lines to. (Bug #29158)</li>
<li>The non-working collision on the Dwemer column that was done in USSEP 4.1.5 has now been corrected and is working properly. (meshes\dungeons\dwemer\smrooms\dwermsmcolumnfixed01.nif) (Bug #26702)</li>
<li>Several meshes which contain editor markers and had corrections made were making those markers visible on XBox consoles. These have now been set to hide those markers from view. This should not affect their useability and the CK will still show them when editing with USSEP loaded. (meshes\dlc01\dungeons\castle\lghalls\casexfreelgdoor01.nif, meshes\dlc01\dungeons\castle\lghalls\casexfreesmdoor01.nif, meshes\dlc01\dungeons\castle\lghalls\casexfreesmdoor02.nif, meshes\furniture\clutter\milllogpile.nif, meshes\uskp\clutter\weaponrack\wrplaqueshield01_invis.nif, meshes\uskp\clutter\weaponrack\wrsingle01_invis.nif, meshes\clutter\weaponrack\WRDisplayCase01.nif)</li>
<li>Due to a logic error in the retroactive update system it was possible for some of the retro scripts to be fired off more than once, which is not supposed to happen. This could result in a potential for CTDs when a fix for one of the leveled lists overflowed the size limits on leveled lists. (Bug #31335) [NOTE: Due to the necessary reversion of the DLC2BaseArrowNordic75 leveled list, this fix will also remove any additions to this list that have been made by scripts from other mods. Those additions will need to be reapplied.</li>

<b><u>Item Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The loot list for expert level spell tomes in dungeons incorrectly uses a global variable setting that's intended to be used on vendor inventories. [LItemSpellTomes75Alteration] (Bug #29507)</li>
<li>Linwe's armor [ThievesGuildVariantCuirassAA] will no longer display invisible arms when nocking a bow. (Bug #29505)</li>
<li>Horker and Ash Yam Stew [DLC2FoodHorkerAshYamStew] was not set to the proper eat sound used by every other stew object in the game. (Bug #29655)</li>
<li>Ancient Nord Arrows (DraugrArrow) needed the WeapMaterialDraugr keyword so they show up in the correct smithing category. (Bug #30203)</li>
<li>The inventory art for the following books and notes didn't match their world art: TG07ValdDebt, dunBleakFallsBarrowNote01, dunLostEchoCaveNote, dunPinewatchNote01, dunPOIReachSwimmerJournal, MQ202GissurNote, DLC1DarkfallCaveNote01, DLC1VCNote1, DLC1_WESC05Note, DLC1_WESC06Orders, DLC1_WESC07Orders, DLC1_WESC08Orders. (Bug #30582, Bug #29656)</li>
<li>DLC2HrodulfsHouseNote01 should have been set to be worth zero gold like others notes in the game. (Bug #31313)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Load Screen Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Load screen TownFalkreath02 wasn't conditioned to stop appearing if Falkreath isn't under Imperial control and Siddgeir isn't jarl. (Bug #30540)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Location Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Bronze Water Cave (BronzeWaterCave) had no acoustic space set. It should have been set to IntDungeonCave. (Bug #29786)</li>
<li>Robber's Cove (RobbersGorge01) had no acoustic space set. It should have been set to IntDungeonCave. (Bug #29786)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Magic, Perk and Skill Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Resist Magic (EnchResistMagicConstantSelf) erroneously had the MagicAlchResistMagic keyword set instead of MagicEnchResistMagic. (Bug #30339)</li>
<li>Graphical effects for the Bound Bow do not match up with the effects when Mystic Binding is in effect. All other bound weapons have effects that match each other. (Bug #29857)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Mesh and Texture Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The Thirsk Mead Hall has a bad texture file path specified in it. (meshes\dlc02\architecture\thirsk\meadhall\dlc2thirskmeadhallexterior01.nif) (Bug #29621)</li>
<li>The terrain section outside the Hall of the Dead in Whiterun had z-fighting along one of the walkway paths. (meshes\architecture\whiterun\wrterrain\wrhallofdeadplatform01.nif) (Bug #29561)</li>
<li>Several ship meshes were corrected in early 2013 to fix missing shader flags but had never been documented. One additional file needed this and has now also been corrected. (meshes/dungeons/ship/shiplarge01.nif, meshes/dungeons/ship/shiplargedaintysload01.nif, meshes/dungeons/ship/shiplongboat01.nif, meshes/dungeons/ship/shiplongboatwreck02.nif, meshes/dungeons/ship/shipwrecklarge01.nif, meshes/dungeons/ship/shipwrecklarge02.nif, meshes/dungeons/ship/shipwrecklarge03.nif, meshes/dungeons/ship/shipwrecklarge04.nif, meshes/dungeons/ship/shiplargekatariah02.nif) (Bug #29641)</li>
<li>Hanging moss had an incorrect alpha threshold setting which caused it to only display half of the moss instead of the entire length. (meshes\plants\hangingmoss01.nif) (Bug #27634)</li>
<li>A filler column used in Dragonsreach lacked collision, allowing the player to escape outside of the level. (meshes\architecture\whiterun\wrinteriors\wrcastle\wrintcastlewallcorin01.nif) (Bug #29525)</li>
<li>Two mine ceiling tiles had no collision which would allow the player to escape the playable areas in some dungeons. (meshes\dungeons\mines\caveepicwall\minececeiling01.nif, meshes\dungeons\mines\caveepic\minecemid01.nif) (Bug #29110)</li>
<li>The Skyforge mesh had some scattered UV mapping issues. (meshes\architecture\whiterun\wrterrain\wrskyforge01.nif) (Bug #22924)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Navmesh Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>The navmesh in Fort Greymoor Prison was broken. Two segments were disconnected from the rest, which causes NPCs to get stuck and be unable to pursue the player through the entire cell block. Two other disconnected islands existed at the top of the tower section of the same cell. (Bug #30337, Bug #29464)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>During A Night To Remember (DA14) Ysolda delivers a different line for female players indicating the spouse is male. This is incorrect since the NPC in question is a hagraven, and those are always female. Thus she should always be referring to said hagraven as she/her. (Bug #28894)</li>
<li>The default response when you tell a guard they're making a mistake after the "Wait... I know you" line was incorrectly restricted to only male players. It was also missing the "Random End" flag. (Bug #29789)</li>
<li>Galmar is supposed to greet you as "Stormblade" when you achieve that rank, but the conditions on the dialogue nonsensically expected you to be a member of both the Legion and the Stormcloaks. (Bug #29788)</li>
<li>DialogueSolitude [000D90ED]: A hello topic intended to only play for a male player character would instead only play for a female player character due to an incorrectly set condition check. (Bug #29787)</li>
<li>Orcs Fighting Forsworn (WE05) does not clean up the generated NPCs when the quest is terminated. (Bug #31302) [NR]</li>
<li>The speech check for the gate guards at Riften always succeeded due to a bad AND/OR mismatch in the dialogue conditions. (Bug #31279)</li>
<li>Deck stairs on the Katariah were mistakenly flagged as stone material. [meshes\dungeons\ship\shiplargekatariah02.nif] (Bug #33154)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Papyrus Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>TrapHitBase: Traps fail to factor in disease resistance when applying them to the player. (Bug #29500)</li>
<li>DLC01WESC03Script: This script called both an OnUnload() and an OnCellDetach() event when only one of these is necessary. Doing this twice throws errors in the log because they both send a Stop command to the quest. (Bug #30585)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Race Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>Burnt spriggans added by the Dragonborn DLC did not have the proper keyword set to exclude them from being fed on by werewolves with the Savage Feeding perk. All other spriggans in the game have this keyword. (Bug #29657)</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</u></b>
<ul>
<li>040216f7: Replaced a mine cave wall that had no collision with the fixed version of the same asset that Bethesda did provide a collision fix for. (Bug #29110)</li>
<li>04027e48: Repositioned a marker for Niyya's AI. It was sticking part way through the prison bars and was also floating above the floor. (Bug #30338)</li>
<li>0007515F: Shadowmark which needed to be readjusted after the barrels next to it were moved. (Bug #29492)</li>

<li>000CF5AA, 000CF5AC, 000CF5DC, 000CF5DD: Eating utensils in Understone Keep that lack appropriate ownership settings. (Bug #29609)</li>
<li>020018EF: Wrong type of wall piece used in part of Arkngthamz; none of the other pieces in the dungeon are the ice variety. (Bug #29625)</li>
<li>000C5EBE: Separated a tree that was placed in the same spot as another one. (Bug #29650)</li>
<li>0002DF55: Wrong type of cave piece used in part of Cronvangr Hall; none of the other pieces in the dungeon are the Falmer variety. (Bug #29651)</li>

<b>USSEP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>A pillar in the Temple of Kynareth was missing a BSX Flags node when its collision was attached in Bug #13345. (Bug #29048)</li>
<li>Ongoing reports, which we have NOT been able to validate in any way, about the unwanted effects book not being added to your inventory have been addressed. That book will now be found leaning against the bookshelf in the Temple of Kynareth. We feel this strikes a balance between having a second shrine object in there with the normal one and the fact that people don't want clutter on their lesser powers menu. This will be the last time we deal with this. If this solution offends your sense of immersion, too bad. If you think we should have been dicks and forced this in via an MCM, too bad, that cuts out too many people who could otherwise benefit from this being here. Any further reports on this subject will be ignored as this solution is as benign as it's going to get.</li>
<li>In The Affairs of Hagravens (dunBlindCliffQST) a previous fix put in place to properly handle killing Petra or Melka caused quest progression to be stopped because the wrong quest stage was being used in the test condition. We have now changed this to the correct stage check and this should allow the quest to resolve properly regardless of what order things are done in. (Bug #29340)</li>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Ghosts in Forelhost incorrectly drop physical loot instead of ghost loot like all the other ghosts in the game. They previously got other bug fixes relating to ghosts but the loot flag was overlooked. (Bug #29368)</li>
<li>Similarly, ghosts in Halldir's Cairn incorrectly drop physical loot instead of ghost loot like all the other ghosts in the game. Halldir himself will not be flagged this way due to his dropping unique loot that would otherwise be lost. (Bug #29242)</li>
<li>Urag-gro Shub does not offer the scrolls given to him in a previous fix because his custom vendor formlist did not include the VendorItemScroll keyword. (Bug #29210)</li>

<b>Animation Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Horse animation files do not play any sounds when associated with non-vanilla horse actors. Normally this would not be addressed by the USSEP but these assets are shipped as part of the base game and are used extensively by both vanilla and Creation Club added horses which makes it more complicated to fix without addressing it at the source.

<li>The NightEyeImodIntro effect caused a flicker right at the end of the transition that was due to incorrect changes made during an official SSE update at some point. (Bug #29046)</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The leveled list for master scrolls erroneously contains 2 expert level scrolls which are already represented in the proper expert list. [LItemScroll100Skill] (Bug #29185)</li>
<li>DLC2SublistEnchNordicSwordAbsorbMagicka should be setting the entries to levels 20, 22, and 25 instead of all being level 1. This is how all of the other lists in this grouping work. (Bug #29094)</li>
<li>DLC2SublistEnchNordicMaceFire and DLC2SublistEnchNordicWarAxeParalyze should both have the "Calculate All <= PC" and "Calculate From Each" boxes checked to be in line with the rest of the sublists. (Bug #29094)</li>
<li>DLC2LItemArmorGauntletsHeavyBest is missing Iron Gauntlets at level 1, and incorrectly has steel set to level 1 instead of level 6. All of the other LItemArmor*Best lists are set up this way. (Bug #29077)</li>
<li>SublistEnchArmorSteelShield01, SublistEnchArmorSteelShield02, and SublistEnchArmorSteelShield03 are erroneously set up to check levels on the items in these sublists, when all of the other sublists are set for level 1. Since the levels are calculated where these sublists are actually called for, this can result in either no reward being given, or only resist magic shields until the player reaches at least level 7. (Bug #29071)</li>
<li>LItemWarlockRobes: This list produced enchanted hooded and non-hooded robes at a 50:50 chance, but for no obvious reason, all unenchanted robes came without a hood. This has been corrected, so unenchanted robes are now either hooded or non-hooded at a 50:50 chance too. (Bug #29391)</li>
<li>TreasWarlockChest, TreasWarlockChestBoss: These treasure chests are used in both necromancer and warlock dungeons, but only ever returned enchanted necromancer robes. Enchanted warlock robes were never found, although the items and a separate loot list existed in the game. (Bug #29399)</li>
<li>NecromancerOutfitHood50: Unlike the naming convention suggests, the chance to obtain a hooded robe from this outfit was not anywhere near 50%. Note that his fix now also makes the unenchanted hooded necromancer robe actually obtainable in the game. With the outfits set up as they were, no NPC was ever wearing it, and necromancer robes do also not appear on vendor lists. (Bug #29417)</li>
</ul>

<b>Location Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The Mortar and Pestle shop in Dawnstar does not always open up when it should due to faction ownership issues on the cell and the door. Several items inside the shop also incorrectly had NPC ownership when they should have none so that the faction ownership takes effect. (Bug #29287)</li>
<li>Gloomreach Hive has no default acoustic space. It should have been set to cave dungeon. (Bug #29341)</li>
</ul>

<b>Magic, Perk and Skill Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The effects for the Cyclone and Battle Fury shouts lacked the MagicShout keyword. (DLC2VoiceCyclone01FFAimedArea, DLC2VoiceCyclone02FFAimedArea, DLC2VoiceCyclone03FFAimedArea, DLC2VoiceBattleFuryFFSelf) (Bug #29241)</li>
<li>The names for the Zahkriisos' Ire and Dukaan's Fury masks were attached to the wrong perks. (Bug #29239)</li>
<li>Paralyze has no impact data set information linked because there was no data set to link it with. (Bug #29113)</li>
</ul>

<b>Mesh and Texture Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Two parts of Riekling bridges had incorrect Havok material sounds set. (meshes\dlc02\architecture\riekling\dlc2rieklingbridgeplatformsmall.nif, meshes\dlc02\architecture\riekling\dlc2rieklingbridgeplatform01.nif) (Bug #29162)</li>
<li>The Dwarven female armor ground object is using an incorrect environment map. (meshes\armor\dwarven\dwarvencuirassfgo.nif) (Bug #29081)</li>
</ul>

<b>Navmesh Fixes</b>
<ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Investor perk dialogue does not use the correct condition checks to determine the amount of gold the player needs to be able to invest. (Bug #29335)</li>
<li>Random innkeeper dialogue in Raven Rock was repeating itself too soon and not allowing all of the available responses to have a chance to play. These will now take 24 hours to reset just like all of the other rumor topics elsewhere in the game. (Bug #29332)</li>
<li>Boti and Jofthor should no longer talk about how Fastred might leave for Riften if she has already done so. (Bug #29243)</li>
<li>Objectives for Toying With The Dead (FreeformRiften21) were still being added to the quest log even if you'd never been to see Vekel about finding the books. (Bug #29310)</li>
<li>During Chasing Echoes (DLC1VQ04) Serana should no longer spam dialogue about her mother being on the other side of the portal if you should decide to leave the ruins before entering the portal. (Bug #29131)</li>
<li>In the random event, "An enemy's gratitude" (WIKill04), it is possible for the person giving the reward to be killed and thus cause the quest to get stuck because you can no longer collect. The "enemy" alias in this quest is now marked protected so that they cannot be killed by random hostiles before you have the chance to collect. (Bug #29128) [NR]</li>
<li>During Lisbet's Missing Shipment (FreeformMarkarthE) if Lisbet is killed before either finding the statue or returning it to her once found, the quest will be permanently stuck in your log and the statue cannot be dropped. To resolve this, a death event has been added to Lisbet's alias which will fail the quest if she dies and stop it. (Bug #29064)</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>CompanionsHousekeepingScript: The SetUpCompanions() function call can become deadlocked and cause the Companions quest system to fail to initialize after chargen. Since this issue manifests at the beginning of a game, it is not possible to fix retroactively. If you are having problems with the Companions quest line on an existing save, the best thing you can do is go do something else and wait. The deadlock should eventually be resolved by the Papyrus VM. (Bug #29333)</li>
<li>DLC1_SF_DLC1HunterBaseIntroEn_01008A8C: This fragment failed to manipulate the gates in Dawnguard Castle as intended because it called the animations directly on the references instead of their Default2StateActivator scripts. (Bug #29293)</li>

<li>The map marker location data for Skyborn Altar was pointing to a random XMarker rather than to the map marker itself.</li>
<li>The map marker location data for Cracked Tusk Keep was pointing to a random XMarker rather than to the map marker itself.</li>
<li>Ancestor Glade is missing its location name, parent location, and worldspace map marker settings.</li>
<li>The room boundings for Angarvunde near the word wall needed to be expanded slightly to make sure portions of that part of the dungeon don't disappear from the screen. (Bug #28943)</li>
<li>NPCs in Solitude sometimes fall through portions of the city due to it being too large to load all of the cells into memory at the same time. Usually this will result in their deaths as they fall through and hit the landscape below, but it can sometimes also lead to them being permanently stranded in the water below the arch. A possible solution has been implemented in the form of a giant trigger box that encompasses the city from one of the cells which always loads. If an NPC falls into the box, they will be returned to their editor location and then be able to resume their schedule as normal from there. (Bug #28929)</li>

<li>Dark Ancestor (FreeformFalkreathQuest03B) does not stop when it should, and Vighar's alias is thus not properly cleared at the end which causes him to "respawn" due to the unique name override in the alias. The alias also needs to be flagged to clear the text on removal. (Bug #28953) [NR]</li>
<li>When the player kills an NPC, the game has the chance of generating a "letter of gratitude" from one of the NPCs enemies [Quest WIKill04]. It was apparently possible for the player themselves to be set as the enemy which would make collecting the reward for the kill impossible. The "Enemy" alias will now prevent the player from satisfying the conditions. (Bug #28980)</li>
<li>DialogueOrcsBlacksmith: A new dialogue response needed to be created to account for the possibility that the Orc blacksmith the player speaks to is male. Proper condition checks needed to be added to both the existing response (0008CBB8) and the new response (06010559). (Bug #25563)</li>

<b>USSEP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The enchantments governing the Pale Blade had once been fixed to provide an extra stamina effect to satisfy the double stamina damage. However this was incorrect because the standard frost damage effect already has a second AV weight of 2 which doubles that damage. Thus the blade was incorrectly delivering 3x stamina damage. This reverts Bug #10179. (Bug #25291)</li>
<li>Argonian Ale and Cyrodilic Brandy have received fixes in official SSE updates and have had their edits removed from the patch. (Bug #25736)</li>
<li>The fixed Dawnguard Rune Hammer effect (UDGPDLC1HunterHammerRuneFireFFLocation) was missing the MagicDamageFire keyword that it should have had. (Bug #25589)</li>
<li>After receiving confirmation that the magic effect duration reversals for Salmon Roe (introduced with the Hearthfire DLC in 2012) were in fact intentional, we have removed these edits from the patch. This reverts Bug #15093.</li>
<li>crReduceDamage05, crReduceDamage075 and crReduceDamage035 were altered in USKP 2.1.3. Since no documentation of the original report exists to explain why this was done, these changes are being removed. (Bug #25813)</li>
<li>An old fix in USKP 1.2.4 to keep Farengar's scene in The World-Eater's Eyrie (MQ303) from playing if he was dead was incorrectly checking his alias without making sure it was actually filled first. If he's been dead a long enough time, it won't fill, but Papyrus will return a result as though he were still alive and then runs the scene anyway. (Bug #25519)</li>
<li>Transparency issues with the Blue Palace entry way and door have been fixed. Our edits have thus been removed from the patch. This reverts Bug #8755. (meshes\architecture\solitude\sbluepalaceentrance.nif, \meshes\architecture\solitude\doors\shousedoor01.nif)</li>

<li>Bonemold Gauntlets and Improved Bonemold Gauntlets did not have keywords to enable the Fists of Steel perk. Regular bonemold now has the keyword for steel, and improved bonemold has the keyword for dwarven. Both of these are based on the closest equivalent weight for vanilla gauntlets. (Bug #25730)</li>
<li>Stalhrim Light Bracers incorrectly had a keyword for the Fists of Steel perk. They are light armors. (Bug #25730)</li>
<li>The Poacher's Axe (dunHaltedStreamPoachersAxe) had an enchantment charge of 0 which resulted in the enchantment not actually working. (Bug #25456)</li>
<li>The Bloodskaal Blade could fail to produce its proper energy wave effect because the object was set to respawn. Which for whatever crazy reason caused the engine to delete the original object despite it being stored in an active quest alias. The replacement would spawn correctly but because it didn't get stored in the alias, the blade broke. Unfortunately this is not possible to fix if this issue has already happened.

<li>The conjuration spells for flame, frost, and storm atronachs - as well as their potent counterparts - were only providing half of the expected skill experience per use due to a quirk in how the magic system interprets a spell with 2 effects. This resulted in it taking an abnormally long time to level conjuration using these spells. (Bug #21400)</li>

<li>If their initial scene in Winterhold is interrupted for some reason, Birna and Ranmir will be forever stuck standing outside her shop. This was both due to the scene not being marked as interruptible (dragon attacks, random wildlife etc can interrupt it) and due to each of them having an alias looking for a condition that will never be set once it's been interrupted. Interrupting it would cause the scene quest to stall and never be terminated. [DialogueWinterholdInitialScene]</li>

<li>The Staff of Magnus effect does not function correctly due to improper handling of the absorption effects it comes with. (Bug #24359)</li>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Truth Ore Consequences (FreeformRiften17) incorrectly sets disposition for Filnjar instead of Hafjorg when it ends. (Bug #24400)</li>
<li>Whiterun guards stationed at the Western Watchtower should not be delivering the line about Riverwood not having a wall since it refers to the city walls in Whiterun itself. (Bug #24331)</li>
<li>During Discerning the Transmundane (DA04) if the player does not take the Elder Scroll and eventually goes on to end the quest without doing so, it becomes impossible to take the scroll due to the activator being set for an alias in DA04 itself. The activator should instead be set to use the alias in MQ00 to get the scroll since MQ00 is a background quest that is never terminated during the life of the game. (Bug #22423)</li>
<li>The Affairs of Hagravens (dunBlindCliffQST) does not correctly terminate objectives when either of the hagravens are killed because both of them are checking for a prerequisite stage that requires you to open Melka's cage when this should only be checking to make sure Melka has tried to get the player's attention. (Bug #20117) [NR]</li>
<li>When speaking to Peryite's vision, it was possible for the player to appear stuck after tabbing out of dialogue. This was due to a script having a bad check on the heading angles when facing the fume pot. (Bug #24777)</li>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Khajiit ears were not showing on the Ragged Cap. (Bug #23314)</li>
<li>The common book "Vernaccus and Bourlor" (Book2CommonVernaccusandBourlor) is used in two different ways. One as a skill book for archery (SkillMarksman3), the other as a commonly distributed book that can be found everywhere. Since skill books are supposed to be rare and all sensible logic says you learn from the content of the book, it becomes a confusion issue for the player if they find it and nothing happens. As a result, the following changes have been made:
 <ul>
  <li>The common version has been removed from 3 leveled lists: LItemBook2All, LItemBookClutter, DLC2LItemBook2Combined</li>
  <li>Placed references to the common book have been replaced with Dummy Books that will pull from the lists the common book used to be in. [0005C647, 000A3954, 000A3B95, 000A47DD, 000AA426, 000AAE03, 000C85C4, 000C85D7, 000C95A8, 000CB5D7, 000CB788, 000CB7EB, 000D4821, 000D5874, 000D7C1A, 000DF47C, 000E278B, 000E2B69, 000E2DE2, 0200E27D, 04031FB9]</li>

<b>USSEP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Due to a rogue edit by the CK back in October 2013 (UHFP 2.0) it was inadvertently made impossible for wolves to attack a Hearthfire house due to the keyword condition being broken. (Bug #22162)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the desiccated spider meal cocoon that caused it to suffer missing triangles. (meshes\effects\fxspiderwebkitdinnerhumangnd.nif)</li>
<li>Fixes done for the Totem of Brotherhood back in UDGP 1.3.0 have been reverted after further attempts to fix the proper tiered system revealed why Bethesda didn't implement it correctly to begin with. (Bug #20018)</li>
<li>Miraak's cultists have finally been subdued! Their gear will no longer produce leg gaps or have odd overlaps or clipping when worn together. Several meshes ended up needing to be repartitioned again and the esp file adjusted to match. (Bug #22149)</li>
<li>Corrected bad conversion for the male and female 1st person beggar clothing meshes. (meshes\clothes\beggarclothes\1stpersontorsof_0.nif, meshes\clothes\beggarclothes\1stpersontorsof_1.nif, meshes\clothes\beggarclothes\1stpersontorsom_0.nif, meshes\clothes\beggarclothes\1stpersontorsom_1.nif) (Bug #22097)</li>

</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Wyndelius did not appear at the correct portcullis in Shroud Hearth Barrow because he was missing one of the required linked reference settings. (Bug #22075)</li>
<li>Olda is marked as the wife of Lodvar and the sister-in-law of Horgeir, which is incorrect given that she’s actually married to Horgeir. (Bug #22309)</li>
</ul>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The male guard voice incorrectly recorded the line about Skyrim needing more healers. It does not match the subtitle or audio from the other entries. (sound\voice\Skyrim.esm\maleguard\dialogueguardsgeneral__000d5eb7_1.fuz) (Bug #21700)</li>
<li>Domesticated goats have a bell on their necks that makes no sound. This has been corrected through a workaround in the sound impact data. (Bug #12817)</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Bolar's Oathblade did not fully recharge due to the enchantment value not being an evenly divisible number of the enchantment cost. The enchantment value is now 575 so that it will charge fully as a multiple of 115. (Bug #21794)</li>
<li>Female Khajiit Dark Brotherhood Shrouded Hand Wraps (DBGlovesKhaAA) were incorrectly pointing to the Argonian models. (Bug #22310)</li>
<li>Sunhallowed and Bloodcursed Elven Arrows lacked the material keyword designating them as Elven arrows. (Bug #21705)</li>

<li>The Morthal shield used for TownMorthal02 was not positioned correctly and has been adjusted. (Bug #22185)</li>
</ul>

<b>Location Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>White Ridge Barrow should have been assigned the LocTypeDraugrCrypt keyword, but was given the LocTypeAnimalDen keyword instead. This could potentially result in it being chosen as a radiant location for Animal Extermination [CR02]. (Bug #22331)</li>
</ul>

<b>Mesh and Texture Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Collision fixes for the area in front of Drunken Huntsman. (meshes\architecture\whiterun\wrterrain\wrdrygoodsbase.nif) (Bug #22061)</li>
<li>Nordic door had incorrect normals on it, resulting in faulty in-game lighting. (meshes\dungeons\nordic\doors\animated\mediumdoor\ruinsmediumdoor01.nif) (Bug #22086)</li>
<li>Male barkeep clothes had a weighting issue that caused neck clipping and jewelry to show through the collar. (meshes\clothes\barkeeper\m\torso_0.nif, meshes\clothes\barkeeper\m\torso_1.nif) (Bug #22320)</li>

<b>Navmesh Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Navmeshing in front of Warmaidens in Whiterun was allowing NPCs to try to walk through objects and take awkward pathing. (Bug #22313)</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>After moving to Riften in With Friends Like These (DB02), Aventus Aretino can sometimes be found stuck trying to navigate his way to the city because Fort Greenwall may not yet be cleared when he leaves Windhelm. He will now be moved to the orphanage via script at the appropriate time. (Bug #22212) [Note to modders: The fixes for Aventus have been moved from the DB01 scripts to the DBEntranceQuest scripts.]</li>
<li>Ainethach's dialogue at the end of the Sanuarach Mine quest (FreeformKarthwastenA) does not exit with a goodbye flag when it should. (Bug #22145)</li>
<li>Serana should no longer repeatedly say "Yes, what did you need?" during Chasing Echoes (DLC1VQ04). (Bug #22104)</li>
<li>If the player ignores Riverwood entirely, or leaves Riverwood after being invited to talk to Alvor or Gerdur but before actually talking to them, they will become stuck in the scenes meant to play out for this and be unable to advance the Main Quest if the player returns. This is due to a bad stage check on an alias script that MQ102A and MQ102B both use to track where the status of friendship is with Alvor or Gerdur. This status will not trigger Bethesda's failsafe properly unless the player visits Dragonsreach AND tells Irileth about the attack on Helgen. This is an event easily avoided, and with the things that need processing, it's possible this is the root cause of a number of early issues in the Civil War with things not behaving properly. (Bug #21507)</li>
<li>During Hitting the Books (MG03) the College students are supposed to gather next to the Eye of Magnus and play out a scene. Due to issues with the scene trigger, this would never happen because the trigger would be encountered prior to this portion of the quest being reached since the trigger box had no conditions and would become disabled upon first entering the Hall of Elements. (Bug #20741)</li>
<li>Ringmaker (FreeformRiften18) should no longer continue to prompt the objective to bring Madesi his items if the objective to do so is in the quest journal. (Bug #22334)</li>
<li>Two of Anoriath's dialogue topics shouldn't have been able to play when he is not at his stand offering services. (Bug #22140)</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>

<b>USSEP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The resource path to the Meat Pie texture was wrong and needed to be corrected. (Bug #22076)</li>
<li>The resource path to the Cave Bear trophy item fixed for Hearthfire was also wrong and needed to be corrected. (Bug #22079)</li>
<li>The mesh conversion for the horse & rider load screen inadvertently caused CTDs when this mesh was instead used as a static in a cell somewhere. Since this is a vanilla asset, we've now fixed this so that all the skin rendering works on the load screen, in-game, and no longer causes a CTD when used in an unorthodox manner. (Bug #21723)</li>

</ul>

<p class="h">v4.0.6 (2017-02-05) [SSE 1.4.2]</p>
<b>USSEP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Changes to vampire eye records were never properly reconciled when the USLEEP merge was done back in July of 2015. They were still configured in such a way as to preserve overwrites from the old individual unofficial patches. This may result in some unexpected changes in vampire appearances, but it is now aligned with the changes Dawnguard intends to make to the game.</li>
<li>dlc2miraakscript has been removed from the archive due to an undocumented fix Bethesda made for SSE that has no source code provided to check. Our changes were just for the debug traces and weren't important anyway.</li>
<li>The crafting recipe for Woodcutter's Axe [USKPTemperWeaponAxe01] mistakenly required use of a steel ingot when it should have been an iron ingot. (Bug #21642)</li>
<li>The MagicAlchBeneficial keyword has been removed from the USKPGiftOfCharity effect due to it causing unwanted interference with speechcraft potions.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The bandit [dunRavenscarTrappedBandit] in Ravenscar Hollow didn't have a default outfit set and would appear naked as a result. (Bug #21872)</li>
<li>Vald lacked the dead body cleanup script which could result in his corpse lingering for ages in Riften. (Bug #21893)</li>
<li>Camilla Valerus can sometimes get stuck in front of the Sleeping Giant, possibly due to the space between her AI markers being too far apart. (Bug #21734)</li>
<li>Dorian is incorrectly set up as a static level NPC capping at level 251 due to what appears to be someone typing the proper range into the wrong boxes. He is also marked essential but has no purpose in being so. (Bug #21736)</li>
<li>Kvenel the Tongue was not configured with the proper keywords for a ghost NPC. (Bug #21971)</li>
<li>Belrand was set to the wrong outfit to match his skills and perks (should be using 4 pieces of hide, not mixed iron and hide) and had no offensive magic spell despite telling the player he does AND being set to use augmented frost. Gave him the Ice Spike spell for that. (Bug #21793)</li>
<li>Karan (spawned corpse in The Reach) had the black face bug and needed new facegen created. (Bug #21749)</li>

<li>Stormcloak Helmet [TemperArmorStormcloakHelmetFull] required use of a leather strip to temper rather than an iron ingot. This has been corrected to match the other hold guard helmets in the game. (Bug #21779)</li>
<li>“Boar Meat”, “Ash Hopper Meat”, “Ash Hopper Leg”, and “Cooked Boar Meat” all display 0 value due to not having set the no-autocalc flag on the items. (Bug #21579)</li>
<li>DLC2Book2CommonRavenRock01, DLC2Book2CommonRavenRock02, DLC2Book2CommonRavenRock03, and DLC2POIUshaNote lacked the "VendorItem" keyword and could not be sold to vendors as a result. (Bug #21861)</li>
<li>Poison Blooms (DLC01PoisonBloom) lacked the VendorItemIngredient keyword and thus could not be sold to alchemists. (Bug #21983)</li>
</ul>

<b>Location Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>BYOHHouse1Falkreath had its weather region set as "WeatherSnow" when it should have been "WeatherPineForest" like the surrounding area. (Bug #21882)</li>
<li>Windstad Manor had an incorrect weather type set for where the exit connects with the exterior. (Bug #21897)</li>

<ul>
<li>Further research into the lore behind Black Soul Gems indicates that although not ideal, they are supposed to be able to carry any type of soul. The only lore restriction on them is the process by which they are made, which is irrelevent in terms of Skyrim loot. The fix for Bug #14194 has therefore been modified to only work on Azura's Black Star, which is definitively mentioned in lore and in-game dialogue as ONLY accepting black souls, while Azura's White Star will only accept white souls (non-human/mer NPCs).</li>
</ul>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Apple Cabbage Stew [FoodAppleCabbageStew] was missing its pickup sound. (Bug #21211)</li>
<li>Corrected Beem-Ja mispronouncing Gathrik's name (Sound\Voice\Skyrim.esm\MaleArgonian\dunIronbin_dunIronbindBetr_00041F83_1.fuz). (Bug #21224)</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Hert and Hern did not have any of the vampire abilities that every other vampire in the game has. (Bug #21221)</li>
<li>Neloth's perk list focuses on ice, shock, and necromancy but his primary spell is a fire spell which doesn't match anything he's set for. (Bug #21214)</li>
<li>Maluril and Agnis were incorrectly added to the Dark Brotherhood faction, causing the player to get expelled if they are attacked. (Bug #21246)</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The Blackguard armors found in Raven Rock do not have a material keyword so they don't count toward the Matching Set perk like they should. (Bug #21195)</li>
<li>ClothesBarKeeperShoes and ClothesChefShoes both had weight values of zero. They have been assigned a weight value of 1 instead. (Bug #21227)</li>
</ul>

<b>Mesh and Texture Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The Sleeping Tree Sap spigot should no longer get displaced from its expected position. A static mesh replacement has been created to solve the problem. (Bug #21053)</li>
<li>Collision on the upper class wardrobe had defects allowing objects to fall inside of it. (meshes\furniture\noble\noblewardrobe01.nif) (Bug #21299)</li>
<li>Ice cliffs have some small holes in them which let you see through. (meshes\dungeons\caves\ice\cliffs\caveicliffs01.nif) (Bug #20990)</li>
<li>Lumber mill has exposed support beams with hollow ends. (meshes\architecture\farmhouse\lumbermill01.nif) (Bug #21160)</li>
<li>The Thalmor embassy gate had shader flags set that were causing partial transparency issues. (meshes\architecture\solitude\spatiogate01.nif) (Bug #21223)</li>
<li>Solitude interior corner piece with bad/missing collision. (meshes\architecture\solitude\interiors\ssmawincor01.nif) (Bug #21300)</li>
<li>Dragonsreach exterior stairway has partial transparency on it. (meshes\architecture\whiterun\wrterrain\wrterwind01.nif) (Bug #21290)</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Several Afflicted don't spawn during The Only Cure (DA13) because the parent marker for them is never enabled. (Bug #21293)</li>
<li>Some of the Forsworn in Cidhna Mine are not properly killed when siding with Thonar in No One Escapes Cidhna Mine (MS02) due to still being locked in protected aliases. (Bug #21254)</li>
<li>If you start the process to escape Cidhna Mine but turn on Madanach while in the ruins, the control quest (MS02EscapeMadanachEnding) is never stopped which results in Thonar hanging around outside the ruins indefinitely. (Bug #21253)</li>
<li>Guild dialogue reflecting completion of all upgrades is never triggered because the status quest (TGStatus) never updates the tracking variable. (Bug #21238)</li>
<li>During "Prophet" (DLC1VQ03Hunter), female Stormcloak soldiers in Dragon Bridge can no longer be asked if they had seen a Moth Priest, as they had no audio recorded. (Bug #21313)</li>
<li>Hroggar will no longer become hostile if Alva's status as a vampire is known if you encounter him afterward. (Bug #21236)</li>
<li>Corrected Orthus Endario's hellos during Rise in the East (MS10) checking the wrong quest stages. (Bug #21226)</li>
<li>During Hide and Seek (DLC1RH01) and A Jarl's Justice (DLC1RH07) it was not considered a crime to attack the disguised vampire despite being warned by Isran that it would be if you were caught. (Bug #21219)</li>
<li>Cleanup for Eltrys' corpse was causing undue delay in allowing dialogue further along in The Forsworn Conspiracy (MS01) to continue as expected. (Bug #21209)</li>
</ul>

<b>Race Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The Netch Calf race did not have the Netch keyword assigned to it. (Bug #21181)</li>

<b>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</b>

<li>Reanimating Endrast or J'zhar and then re-killing them could trigger the quest Rejoining the College [MGRejoinQuest]. This could occur because both of them were set to be members of CollegeofWinterholdFaction which serves no purpose for dead NPCs. (Bug #21011, Bug #20995)</li>

<li>The Elemental Potency perk does not function correctly for NPCs who have it due to the condition checks being on the magic effects rather than the basic spell entries. (Bug #21166)</li>

<b>Navmesh Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>There is no navmesh up to the base of the Nocturnal shrine that gets built in the Ragged Flagon Cistern. (Bug #21013)</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>If the player activates all 3 DLCs at once on a save of sufficient level and MQ advancement, it is possible for Miraak's Cultists, Durak, and the Courier to all spawn at the same time when entering a population center. Due to this, Durak will often turn hostile against the player (and thus cause the entire Dawnguard to do the same) when the cultists are attacked. The city guards will jump in against Durak if they are around as well, which then turns the whole thing in to a city-wide brawl that will never end. The event which enables Durak will be blocked if the Cultist quest has not triggered the first journal stage in order to prevent these melees from occurring. (Bug #21016)</li>
<li>The intimidation option for the bandits at Valtheim Keep (dunValtheimKeepQST) did not have a goodbye flag set if the player succeeded. (Bug #21121)</li>
<li>Miraak's initial scene with the player (DLC2MQ02MiraakApocryphaScene) has an incorrect gender check which blocks the response line for female characters. (Bug #21128)</li>
<li>During the marriage ceremony quest (RelationshipMarriageWedding) the package your spouse uses to forcegreet after Maramal completes the ceremony will have failed because it was being set off to soon, causing them to attempt to leave the area before the dialogue is done. (Bug #21023)</li>
<li>Also during RelationshipMarriageWedding, it's possible to cause the ceremony to fail if the player gets impatient and tries to click past all the dialogue. (Bug #21024)</li>
<li>Repentance (dunDarklightQST) was erroneously set up in the story manager, which could cause it to restart itself unexpectedly. The quest also has an unnecessary "allow repeat stages" flag which further exaggerates problems with this. It ALSO had multiple shutdown stages selected, which doesn't work. The quest is set to stop in stage 55 as the result of a previous USKP fix, so there should be no shutdown stage set now. (Bug #21165)</li>
<li>During Blood on the Ice (MS11) the quest marker will remain over Viola when you find the journal and show it to her when she wasn't assisting you in finding it. (Bug #21176)</li>
<li>Several quests erroneously set the "Uses Stored Text" flag on actors populating aliases. This can then lead to permanent name changes that shouldn't happen since these quests didn't need to use that flag anyway. Affected quests: Trouble in Skyrim (CR05), The Bonds of Matrimony (RelationshipMarriage), DialogueFollower, Kill the Giant [Jarl] (Favor153), Kill the Vampire (Favor109), Salty Sea-Dogs (FreeformShipsDawnstar), Family Heirloom (CR06). (Bug #21141)</li>
<li>Olfrid Battle-Born's essential status is not cleared after Imitation Amnesty (TGTQ03) like the other Thieves Guild quest NPCs. (Bug #21164)</li>
<li>3 dialogue scenes in the Blue Palace were incorrectly set to run even if the Civil War was over. (Bug #20639)</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>CWSiegeCityDoorScript: Invalid method used to check if the besieged city is Whiterun. The condition was always valid. This could result in Hadvar or Ralof appearing to follow the player at the wrong battle site and then never leaving after that. (Bug #21161)</li>
</ul>

<b>Race Fixes</b>

<li>DLC2LurkerRace did not have the ActorTypeDaedra keyword set. It was also incorrectly named "Giant" instead of "Lurker". (Bug #21101)</li>

<li>In First Lessons (MG01) it is still possible to tell Faralda you are interested in Elder Scrolls even if you have completed enough of Elder Knowledge and Seeking Disclosure (meaning you have the scrolls already). Her dialogue is referencing an incorrect quest stage. (Bug #20940)</li>
<li>Also in MG01, it is not possible to ask Faralda if they'd admit the Dragonborn due to an incorrect quest stage comparison if the main quest was advanced far enough. (Bug #20940)</li>
<li>Bassianus Axius has a 3rd greeting that should be available but cannot play due to a bad condition check. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bassianus_Axius#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>

<b>USLEEP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Static horker mesh was accidentally edited with absolute paths for the textures. (meshes\dlc02\plants\dlc2horker01.nif) (Bug #20227)</li>
<li>The atronach forge leveled list fix accidentally included USLEEPLItemEnchDaedricBattleaxeATRO in the LItemEnchDaedricAnyWeapon list instead of LItemEnchDaedricBattleaxe. This change has been reverted. The LItemEnchDaedricATROFORGE leveled list is also a dead entry and has been removed. (Bug #20216)</li>
<li>Numerous vampires were missing their intended Chill Touch attack overrides due to an old bug in xEdit which has now been corrected. (Bug #20460)</li>
<li>Jaree-Ra could become stuck for several hours inside Angeline's Aromatics after the execution scene plays out upon first entering Solitude. He has now been shifted to the Winking Skeever so that he can't be trapped by locked doors he doesn't have permission to open. (Bug #20497)</li>
<li>The previous fix to prevent duplicate copies of Stormfang from spawning was interfering with the ability of the Skaal to assign quests to kill bandit leaders because the game insisted on choosing a location that should not have been able to accept the quest (Reaver Lord was dead etc). The issue will now be corrected via the weapon and a pair of leveled lists that will stop it from spawning again once the player loots it. (Bug #20185)</li>
<li>The edit to LItemEnchCircletEnchanting done in Bug #15151 was later rendered useless and is now a dead edit. It has been removed. (Bug #20542)</li>
<li>The missing skin segments for the female ebony armor fixed by the USKP ages ago has been restored. (Bug #18926)</li>
<li>DLC1nVampireBloodMagicRingErudite: Reverted a change made in UDGP 1.2.1 involving the description text for Ring of the Erudite. The enchantment is really a raw value increase rather than a percentage boost, so the original description was actually accurate. (Bug #20387)</li>

<li>Followers were unable to keep up with the player if entering Blackreach via Mzinchaleft Gatehouse due to an incomplete navmesh. (Bug #19637)</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Torbjorn's line about leaving Tova alone in Rare Gifts (Favor110) was incorrectly conditioned to check for Tova being dead. Due to the weird way her death is actually handled, it needs to check a quest variable rather than for the Actor herself actually being dead. (Bug #20270) [Why it's stored in Favor110 is anyone's guess]</li>
<li>If Rare Gifts (Favor110) is running when Nilsine is killed and Torbjorn is the quest giver, the quest needs to be shut down and Torbjorn removed from the faction allowed to start it since it relies on Tova being alive. If the player has already accepted it and it's in the journal, they will be allowed to turn in the Amulet of Arkay. (Bug #20610)</li>
<li>It was possible for the Silver Hand Stratagem in Stealing Plans (CR10) to fall off of the top of the spawn chest and end up getting kicked around the main area of Jorrvaskr. The alias for the spawn chest has been changed to the marker in the fake room outside the playable area so this won't happen anymore. (Bug #20042)</li>
<li>Ra'zhinda was incorrectly offering training for lockpicking when she does not have the lines to do so with. (Bug #20433)</li>
<li>An incorrect actor was used to run the skooma spring scene in Redwater Den (DLC1dunRedwaterDenQST). (Bug #20434)</li>
<li>The Blade of Riften reward for the Thane quest (FreeformRiftenThane) is not properly leveled like the other Thane quest items due to the quest being started from the moment the game is running. The reward should now be properly generated when the quest is completed. (Bug #20084) [NR]</li>
<li>Galmar sometimes does not reach his proper position during Season Unending (MQ302) due to a bad radius on his AI scene package when everyone is supposed to be sitting down. (Bug #20429)</li>
<li>After Lights Out! (MS07) the fire at the Lighthouse is never relit. (Bug #19942)</li>
<li>If the player managed to anger Maul when entering Riften before they've found one of the Unusual Gems, the objective that gets displayed points to the wrong target. (TGCrown) (Bug #20077)</li>
<li>During Forbidden Legend (dunGauldursonQST), if the player takes any of the sealed writs the journal entries get changed even if they have picked up fragments of the amulet and already know about the quest. (Bug #20104)</li>
<li>Styrr should not offer dialogue about Roggvir being buried in the hall until the execution is over. (Bug #20499)</li>
<li>Maul should no longer display a topic to ask about the Unusual Gems if you have already entered the Thieves Guild and talked to Vex in No Stone Unturned (TGCrown). (Bug #20477)</li>
<li>During Ill Met By Moonlight (DA05) speaking to Mathies after having spoken to Sinding causes an objective to get stuck telling you to speak to Sinding. (Bug #20609)</li>
<li>Ancient Technology (DLC1RH05) should not be mentioned by the Dawnguard radiant system once all of the collection quests for this line are done because it sticks an objective in the journal that can no longer be resolved since Sorine won't actually have the quests. (Bug #20590)</li>
<li>Ambarys Rendar, in the New Gnisis Corner Club, sometimes welcomes the player by saying "Come on in. We got warm food, warm drinks, and warm beds." This doesn't make sense given that there are no beds available for rent. A condition check has been added to prevent that dialogue scene from playing in this particular location. (Bug #20409)</li>
<li>Bralsa Drel has three dialogue lines that no longer make sense after the Raven Rock Mine has been reopened. Condition checks have been added to prevent this from occurring. (Bug #20600)</li>

<b>USLEEP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The previously generated fix for the Kolbjorn Barrow roombounds bug has been improved to remove the need for the custom static record and mesh that were created for it initially. The fix has been reworked to use multibound links on the affected references instead. (Bug #19929)</li>
<li>The fixed Dwemer convector mesh was stored in the wrong folder and has been moved to the correct one. (meshes\clutter\containers\dwesoulgemcontainer01.nif) (Bug #19955)</li>
<li>The Dead Thrall fix done for Bug #919 turns out to have been completely unnecessary. It has been verified via script logging that the intended effect removal is NOT being handled by our script, but is instead being properly removed by the game when a thrall is killed - as it should be. As a result, the modifications made for this have been reverted out.</li>
<li>High Elf Vampire Warpaint 2 had an incorrect texture path specified when the warpaint fixes were done. (Bug #19977)</li>
<li>Khajiit vampires have incorrect value for attack multiplier due to a merge regression. (Bug #20067)</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Faendal and Anoriath needed their facegen files regenerated due to displaced eyelashes.

<li>DunYsgramorsTomb_LvlGhostMelee1HMale, DunYsgramorsTomb_LvlGhostMelee2HFemale, and DunYsgramorsTomb_LvlGhostMelee2HMale had incorrect confidence values set due to having been duplicated from bandit templates but not updated like the other counterparts of the same type. (Bug #19971)</li>

<li>The goat [00083E2A] in Druadach Redoubt will often be killed by one of the Forsworn. This was due to improperly set faction relationships between "DruadachRedoubtFaction" and "GoatFaction". Set the relationships between them to friend. (Bug #19948)</li>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The second sound setting for PHYMaterialBlade2HandImpact was incorrectly using the same setting as the first, which results in inconsistencies in how impact sounds for the materials work. (Bug #20059)</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>LItemEnchDaedricAnyWeapon, used by the Atronach Forge, had rewards which were calculated by level at the end of their sublist chains. This would cause the forge to generate nothing for a player less than level 47 if the reward was going to be a Daedric weapon. The same issue could cause there to be missing loot upon killing high level dragons which were added by Dawnguard. The list has had all of its components copied and all the level restrictions used in it removed so that they will output properly. (Bug #19951)</li>
<li>DLC1DeathItemWerewolf should be dropping werewolf pelts rather than normal wolf pelts when werewolves are killed. (Bug #19972)</li>
<li>Multiple lower tier enchanted weapons were set to the wrong enchantment value - being much lower than they should have been. (Bug #19968)</li>
<li>The Keepers of the Razor (DA07KeepersoftheRazorNotes) used the wrong pick up sound. (Bug #20065)</li>
<li>DLC2EnchArmorBonemoldCuirassLightArmor01, DLC2EnchArmorBonemoldCuirassLightArmor02, and DLC2EnchArmorBonemoldCuirassLightArmor03 were using the fortify enchantment for light armor but should have been using the fortify enchantment for heavy armor since Bonemold is heavy. (Bug #19982)</li>
<li>Venison [FoodVenison] had an incorrect keyword set. It should be "VendorItemFoodRaw" instead of "VendorItemFood". (Bug #19946)</li>
</ul>

<b>Location Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The Ragged Flagon required the placement of room bounds to separate light sources. This should prevent certain light sources from going out when looked at from an angle. (Bug #19918)</li>
</ul>

<b>Mesh and Texture Fixes</b>

<li>A number of small navmesh defects have been corrected on the Solitude Docks. (Bug #19980)</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Gjalund Salt-Sage needs to be exempt from Rescue Mission (CR08) or his participation in that will break the opening quest for the Dragonborn DLC. (Bug #19926)</li>
<li>Bodies of the raiders in Alftand never clean up because dunAlftandQST never terminates. The aliases did not have OnDeath scripts attached to set the expected stages. (Bug #19921)</li>
<li>The tier 5 Ancient Frost Atronach that is generated during Touching the Sky (DLC1_BF_DunTempleQST) was incorrectly set to the same record as the tier 4 alias directly before it. (Bug #19966)</li>
<li>Serana has two lines she should not use again after Awakening (DLC1VQ01) that will repeat anyway due to the Say Once bug. These lines are now conditioned to block once Awakening is complete. (Bug #19954)</li>
<li>The quest that provides the tavern rumor about Jaree-Ra having a job for you (MS07Rumor) is never terminated once Lights Out! (MS07) is started. (Bug #19969)</li>
<li>Alva does not move to Movarth's Lair fast enough during Laid To Rest (MS14) and can end up disrupting the mob scene outside. She will now be script moved at the appropriate time to avoid this. (Bug #19861)</li>
<li>Fardus does not properly mark the Shrine of Azura on your map during his wilderness encounter (WEJS10) if you have never triggered the associated quests.</li>
<li>Hadvar continued to offer up his topic on the prisoners in Helgen after the player asked, despite there being a variable set up to prevent this. (Bug #19935)</li>
<li>Frea has a topic where it becomes possible to ask about her mother twice and offer up two different exclusive responses when this should not happen. (Bug #19936)</li>
<li>During Unseen Visions (DLC1VQ06), the vampire or Dawnguard attackers who get enabled are never disabled again after the quest is over. This leads to some of them respawning back in Ancestor Glade later when they aren't supposed to. (Bug #19927)</li>
<li>Tonilia will no longer repeat her initial greeting welcoming you to the Thieves Guild. (Bug #20019)</li>
<li>Brynjolf does not properly head track the player when making them the Guild Master. (Bug #20088)</li>
<li>The Break of Dawn (DA09) was not stopping the randomizer for Meridia's Beacon if the player found it before visiting Mount Kilkreath. (Bug #20060)</li>
<li>One variant of bandits attacking a Hearthfire house (and possibly kidnapping your spouse) was misconfigured to run every 50000 game hours (that's 104 DAYS of real time) and would thus only run once even though it's meant to be a regularly recurring event. The reset timer has been changed to 550 hours, which reflects similar times in the other related adjacent quests. (Bug #20057)</li>
<li>Rescue Mission (CR08) would display the objective to talk to the victim even if you were already escorting them back to safety. (Bug #20038)</li>
<li>During Missing In Action (MS09) if the player skips delivering proof to Avulstein, the objective to do so is never cleared and a quest marker continues to point to nothing. (Bug #19993)</li>
<li>Veezara's dead version during Death Incarnate (DB10) loads naked even though he should be outfitted in Dark Brotherhood armor. His reference will now equip the items when loaded, using the same technique that fixed Kodlak. (Bug #19991)</li>

<li>000080D7F, 00080E0D, 00F03C8, 000F03CB, 000F03CC, 000F0649 : Now enabled by the DBSanc_DB10DuringAndPostFire_Enable marker. The DB sanctuary after the attack from the Penitus Oculatus and after the Nightmother coffin cutscene (where she tells you to find Astrid) was lacking the rubble statics it had during the fire scene a few minutes sooner, causing roombound mess and unrendered objects when the camera 'falls' in a specific area between the main hall and a close room adjacent to the Sithis stained glass room. (Bug #20072)</li>
<li>00064FD0, 000B33F4 : This fire with embers and associated light in DB sanctuary are now never disabled. After killing Astrid this fire is the only interactive object available in Nazir's AI package, and it was odd to see him warming his hands over cold ashes... (Bug #20072)</li>
<li><s>03016854 : ShipRowBoat01 disabled - Explanation : 0200299D is a ShipRowBoat01 added by Dawnguard, 03016854 is a ShipRowBoat01 added by Hearthfire. The problem is that these 2 boats are exactly at the same place and same coordinates, causing z-fighting. The Dawnguard one comes with sitting markers and has a ferry function. The Hearthfire one seems to be purely cosmetic. So, it was disabled. (Bug #20072)</s> [Fixed by Bethesda in SSE]</li>

<b>USLEEP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The Dawnstar scene with Brina Merilis and Jarl Skald would not activate properly because of a reversed AI condition check on their packages. (Bug #19939)</li>
<li>The fix for the Dark Souls perk not applying properly to reanimated corpses was actually done backward. The one spell that had the extra effect actually needs to have that removed and the others we previously edited need to be reverted back to their previous states. (Bug #19937)</li>

<li>Flame Cloak, Frost Cloak, Shock Cloak, Stendarr's Aura, and Whirlwind Cloak all incorrectly had "Power Affects Magnitude" checked instead of "Power Affects Duration". (Bug #19898)</li>
<li>Stendarr's Aura Light needs the "Power Affects Duration" flag added to match the fix for the main spell. (Bug #19898)</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Annekke has a hello topic discussing the Eldergleam which should only be used if she is in Darkwater Crossing due to talking about it in specific directions. (Bug #19902)</li>
<li>Mikael and Hulda have a scene in which the opening line cannot be delivered due to bad time of day conditions. This results in the rest of the scene getting blocked. (Bug #19901)</li>
<li>Wizard Duel (WIChangeLocation03) and Magic Student (WIChangeLocation04) can both be called at the same time if Restoration is the first magic skill to reach 50. This results in the duelist wizard attacking you while the student is trying to talk. (Bug #19892)</li>

<p class="h">v3.0.1 (2016-01-30)</p>
<b>USLEEP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>A fix for a bad stage check during The Final Descent (DLC2RR03) was not merged over completely resulting in a minor error. (Bug #19641)</li>
<li>AI pack fixes for Morgul and Slitter did not get merged. (Bug #19642)</li>
<li>Purchasing the child's bedroom at Breezehome was not possible on the Dragonsreach balcony due to a condition that was missed during the merge. (Bug #19643)
<li>Navmesh regression fix: USKP 1.2.5 fixed a broken navmesh in Irkngthand Slave Pens, but bug #8171 caused jump markers to be removed that cause followers to aggro a bunch of Falmer because they need to go back around. (Bug #19644)</li>
<li>HouseDecorateSolitude, HouseDecorateRiften, and HouseDecorateWhiterun did not get updated during the merge to account for the Hearthfire addition of the childrens bedrooms. (Bug #19731)</li>
<li>Light sources for Bug #14153 did not get copied during the merge process. (Bug #19693)</li>
<li>Facegen data for Sybille Stentor and Hert were incorrectly forwarded from the old USKP files and have been removed. The Dawnguard facegen files are correct and should be allowed to take priority. (Bug #19739)</li>
<li>After further review of what constitutes a "shopkeeper" the following NPCs will no longer have investment options added by USLEEP: Anoriath, Brand-Shei, Grelka, Madesi, and Marise. (Bug #19805)</li>
<li>Corrected the fix for Eltrys' corpse disappearing to call the body cleanup timer on the dead version rather than immediately clearing the corpse out. (Bug #19508)</li>
<li>The previous tavern furniture fix for stopping servers from approaching you at cooking stations has been expanded to cover all "Special" furniture types so that using alchemy or enchanting stations or other specialized furniture objects will not cause the server to approach you. (Bug #19502)</li>
<li>During A Night To Remember (DA14) we forgot to disable Moira in a retro script if the quest had advanced to revealing Morvunskar. Moira should not remain active after that. (Bug #19660)</li>
<li>Location reservations for Driftshade Sanctuary and Glenmoril Coven have been moved to a USLEEP-only quest. The previous aliases added to C00 have been removed. This should improve compatibility with mods that have not been forwarding fixes from the patch like they should be.</li>
<li>Corrected edits for the small cooking spit that caused a smear due to buggy data exporting. (meshes\clutter\woodfires\spitsmall01.nif) (Bug #19517)</li>
<li>Corrected an incomplete normal map fix for Khajiit tails. (textures\actors\character\khajiitmale\bodymale_msn.dds, textures\actors\character\khajiitfemale\femalebody_msn.dds) (Bug #19663)</li>
<li>The first person armor mesh for Linwe's armor had an incorrect weighted mesh created for it in 2012. (meshes\armor\thievesguild\m\1stpersontorsovariant_1.nif) (Bug #13508)</li>
<li>The "Letter From a Friend" event (WICastMagic04) had a condition for checking if the player was detected, but because this turned out to require a target and getting that information wasn't feasible, the condition ended up making the even so rare as to be almost impossible. This change has now been reverted out. (Bug #19869)</li>
<li>Did some corrective Photoshop filtering on the Solstheim LOD atlas normal map that had been generated after fixing the Miraak Temple LOD. (textures\terrain\DLC2SolstheimWorld\Objects\dlc2solstheimworld.objects_n.dds) (Bug #19847)</li>
<li>DialogueGeneric [000D3DE6]: A fix previously done to prevent this dialogue topic from playing while in Solstheim mistakenly placed the location condition check at the bottom of the list of checks instead of at the top like it should have been. As a result, the dialogue topic could sometimes be spoken by unsupported voice types which in turn would result in no audio being played. (Bug #19842)</li>
<li>Corrected bad bounds settings on the SHouseForSale_LOD which had been fixed in a previous update. (Bug #19897)</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>After further review of what constitutes a "shopkeeper" the following NPCs can now be invested in with the Investor perk: Falion, Filnjar, Madena, Moth gro-Bagol, and Glover Mallory. (Bug #19805)</li>
<li>Investing in Ghorza's shop was incorrectly adding to Moth gro-Bagol's investment pool in addition to her own. (Bug #19805)</li>
<li>The 3rd tier fire dragon was incorrectly based on a 4th tier template which caused them to spawn as level 40 rather than the correct level 30 they should be. (Bug #19806)</li>
<li>Brother Verulus would still stand around waiting on Thongvor after the Stormcloaks take Markarth because his AI package was not checking Thongvor's government faction status. (Bug #19782)</li>
<li>EncThalmor02Melee1HF, EncThalmor02Melee1HFDual, and EncThalmor02Melee1HFShield were incorrectly using EncThalmor01Melee1HM as a template base when they should be using EncThalmor02Melee1HM. (Bug #19780)</li>
<li>If Melaran takes over as Court Wizard in Solitude, his AI schedule does not match what his dialogue says he's doing. (Bug #19640)</li>
<li>Andurs did not have a Boss reference marker like the other temple priests. (Bug #19626)</li>
<li>AI package ShorsStoneSylgjaEatBreakfast5x1 was incorrectly set as a travel package, causing Sylgja to stand in one spot in front of her door for an hour. (Bug #19609)</li>
<li>LvlDraugrAmbushWarlockFemale was incorrectly set to use a male draugr template, causing it to show up with a beard. (Bug #19597)</li>
<li>Bolar's AI pack to work her alchemy table was incorrectly setup as a sit package when it should be a sandbox package. (Bug #19571)</li>
<li>Sylgja had an incorrect persist location that could contribute to her becoming stuck inside her house. (Bug #19499)</li>
<li>The housecarl follow package in Morthal results in whoever holds the position standing too close to the Jarl and often acting strangely. This package has now been repurposed as an escort package for when the Jarl leaves to confront Falion in the marsh during Falion's Secret (FreeformMorthalA). (Bug #19487)</li>
<li>Celann and Ingjard have a skill configuration for heavy armor but are incorrectly set to use light armor. (Bug #19460)</li>
<li>King Borgas should no longer have duplicated Draugr helms equipped when encountering him in Korvanjund. (Bug #19458)</li>
<li>Brina Merilis, Horik Halfhand, and Skald the Elder will no longer be stuck outside the Jarl's longhouse if Dawnstar is handed over to the Imperials before the player has ever been there. (Bug #18421)</li>
<li>Summoned Fire Wyrms should no longer be hostile toward the Lost Souls in the Soul Cairn. (Bug #13990)</li>
<li>Due to some really terrible scripting, Sofie would end up overloading her merchant inventory with useless flower baskets. This script polled every 10 seconds while she was loaded and could in theory result in her having enough baskets to overflow the reference counts. This script has now been removed, and her AI package has been modified to instead play the idle continuously. In addition, the AI pack script will slowly remove the baskets over time as they are not needed for her schedule to function. (Bug #19804)</li>
<li>Maul never went home to sleep at night due to a quest alias package that was overriding his base packages. The alias package was also of the wrong type, so he would never lean against the crate as intended. (Bug #19601)</li>
<li>Potent Storm Thrall had incorrect health and magicka stats due to being set to the wrong class, unlike its lesser counterpart. (Bug #19545)</li>
<li>Commander Maro should not be available for Companions intimidation quests. Added to CR04ExclusionFaction. (Bug #19603)</li>
<li>Saffir's reading package does not use the book reading idles. (Bug #19715)</li>
<li>Some Court Wizards knew no spells despite being presented as powerful mages. (Bug #19456)</li>
<li>The Stormcloak guard in Stonehills (GuardHjaalmarchSons) was not a member of the Stormcloak faction. (Bug #19457)</li>
<li>Serana should no longer have access to her basic vampiric drain spell once she has been cured. (Bug #19466)</li>
<li>Dark Brotherhood members do not sleep in the Dawnstar Sanctuary due to not having proper sleep schedules. Babette's bed and the player's bed have been marked as owned to prevent NPCs who shouldn't use them from trying. One additional bed in the common room has been added to provide adequate space for sleeping. (Bug #19439)</li>
<li>Apothercary service factions for spouses were checking validity for the JobSpellFaction when they should be checking for the JobApothecaryFaction. (Bug #19856)</li>
<li>Quaranir will stand rooted in one spot after arriving at the Frozen Hearth in Wintherhold when he leaves the college. His AI pack was set to simply travel to the cell and then do nothing.</li>
</ul>

<b>Location Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The following inns have been corrected to use the "Large wood building" acoustic setting instead of stone: Frostfruit Inn, Four Shields Tavern, Braidwood Inn, Moorside Inn, and Old Hroldan Inn. (Bug #19631)</li>
<li>The following locations lacked a LocationCenterMarker, which could prevent them from being picked for radiant quests: Pride of Tel Vos, Rift Watchtower, Bloodlet Throne, Snowpoint Beacon, Evergreen Grove, Traitor's Post, Bleakwind Bluff, Broken Limb Camp, Red Road Pass, Sightless Pit, Bronze Water Cave, Cold Rock Pass, Greywater Grotto, Refugees' Rest, Abandoned Prison, Bannermist Tower, Boulderfall Cave, Mzinchaleft, Peak's Shade Tower, Roadside Ruins, Tumble Arch Pass, and Widow's Watch Ruins. (Bug #19823, Bug #19821, Bug #19818, Bug #19817, Bug #19824, Bug #19827)</li>
<li>Ironback Hideout and Orphan's Tear did not have the proper keywords to indicate them as bandit camps. They also lacked LocationCenterMarkers. (Bug #19773)</li>
<li>Sky Haven Temple had no designated horse marker. One has been selected for it outside the cave in Karthspire. (Bug #19509)</li>
<li>River flow in cell -31,11 points the wrong direction. (Bug #19461)</li>
<li>Angi's Camp had no location keyword set. This appears to have led to it not playing any sort of music when visited. (Bug #19484)</li>
</ul>

<b>Magic, Perk and Skill Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Wall of Frost is missing a menu icon and has an incorrect casting loop sound set. The associated projectile effect is also missing a light object. (Bug #19701)</li>
<li><s>Raise Zombie, Revenant, Dread Zombie, and Dead Thrall did not properly benefit from the Dark Souls perk as they were supposed to. The effects that were created never got added to the spells. (Bug #19812)</s> [USLEEP 3.0.2b]</li>
<li>The "Pack Member" wolves (HowlSummonWolf, DLC1HowlSummonIceWolf, DLC1HowlSummonWerewolf) would not attack vampires or other hostile wilderness creatures due to being members of the same wilderness creature factions. This was caused when Bethesda duplicated them from the generic wolves. They did not remove them from these factions afterward. (Bug #19617)</li>
<li>Quick Reflexes should no longer get stuck on the slow time effect. A workaround timer has been added to stop it after 2 seconds. The effect is only supposed to last for 1 second so this should give it plenty of time. (Bug #11971)</li>
<li>Tier 2 and Tier 3 of the Fire Breath shout (VoiceFireBreathEffect2, VoiceFireBreathEffect3) lack the full set of effect flags like Tier 1 has. (Bug #19857)</li>
<li>Clear Skies does not clear the weather in Winterhold despite all indications it should do so. This was due to a weather region setting that had snow storms set to 100%. This has been corrected to 99% snow storm and 1% cloudy, since the shout requires there to be a "pleasant" weather variety available. As a side effect of this, it will now be 1% possible in normal gameplay for Winterhold to have cloudy weather instead of a snow storm. (Bug #19800)</li>

<li>Static prisoner carts had collision below the wood surface. (meshes\furniture\prisonercarriage\prisonercarriage01static.nif) (Bug #18947)</li>
<li>The door to Neloth's staff enchantment area blocks navigation when open, which leads to some of his quests failing to run because he won't leave the room. The collision on the mesh apparently cuts the navmesh when it shouldn't. The door mesh has been modified so both halves will pull up into the ceiling to avoid the issue.

<b>Navmesh Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>NPCs and creatures are unable to properly navigate throughout Brittleshin Pass due to a poor navmesh. (Bug #19751)</li>

<li>Broken navmesh border connection on the north side of cell -40,0. [River area east of Left Hand Mine] (Bug #19607)</li>

<li>Followers could not navigate down to the word wall area in Angarvunde due to an incomplete navmesh. (Bug #19512) [NR]</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>When the Thalmor Embassy party (MQ201Party) shuts down, the aliases in BardSongs need to be flushed out or Illdi will attempt to travel to the Embassy if the player does not trigger another instance of the quest. This will likely result in her death at the hands of wildlife or dragons. (Bug #19501)</li>
<li>Several timing and head tracking issues have been corrected in Danica's scene with Maurice for The Blessings of Nature (T03). (Bug #19776)</li>
<li>The Whiterun gate guard will no longer perform endless forcegreets if the player decides to "come back later" when trying to go to Whiterun the first time. (Bug #19808)</li>
<li>Agmaer, Beleval and Ingjard did not have their AI packages for joining the fight at Castle Volkihar even though all of the markers, packages, and other conditions had been set up for them. (Bug #19757)</li>
<li>Stabalized (FreeformRiften22) did not shut down properly when the player refused to help Shadr with his debt. (Bug #19737)</li>
<li>The random encounter with Balbus (WEJS02) was still not shutting down due to the alias not registering itself to stop the quest when Balbus unloaded. In addition to fixing this, the quest will no longer run if he has given you the Gourmet reward, or if he has been killed at some point. (Bug #19639)</li>
<li>If Luburk is dead, BardSongStarter will no longer launch which would in turn cause bard song setups to fail for the rest of the game. His alias is not even used in the quest so it has been marked optional to prevent this situation from happening. (Bug #19611)</li>
<li>It was possible to tell Vald you had erased his debt even though you had not yet been to Maven Black-Briar to turn in the Quill of Gemination. A bad stage check on one of the dialogue lines in The Pursuit (TG07) was responsible for this. (Bug #19690)</li>
<li>Ashfallow Citadel should be blocked from use in radiant quests such as Fetch Me That Book (MGR20, MGR20B) until Served Cold (DLC2RR02) is completed. (Bug #19612)</li>
<li>Due to bugs in Yngol Barrow and an unmarked quest in Winterhold (dunYngolBarrowQST and FreeformWinterholdA) it was possible to acquire 2 copies of the Coral Dragon Claw, which was not intended. This is in part due to the Winterhold quest being part of an unfinished quest that was never completely disabled. (Bug #19569)</li>
<li>Brunwulf and Malthyr Elenil would play their scene (WindhelmMainGateIntroScene in DialogueWindhelm) after the Imperials took over the city if the player had never been to the Gray Quarter. Since the scene mentions talking to Ulfric, it should no longer play. (Bug #19533)</li>
<li>Brunwulf and Aval would play their scene (DialogueWindhelmMarketSceneBrunwulfAval) in the Grey Quarter even if the Empire had won the war. Since it talks about speaking to Ulfric, it is no longer relevant once he's dead.</li>
<li>Hermir and Oengul have two scenes in Windhelm that should no longer play if Ulfric is dead. (DialogueWindhelmBlacksmithScene1 & DialogueWindhelmBlacksmithScene2) (Bug #19532)</li>
<li>Oengul has a line of dialogue about the war bringing him business which is not appropriate to play if Ulfric is dead. (Bug #19531)</li>
<li>If A Lovely Letter (FreeformRiverwood01) was still running when marrying Camilla Valerius, it was still possible to finish it by delivering the letter on behalf of one or the other even though this no longer made sense to allow. (Bug #19526)</li>
<li>Aventus Aretino leaves Windhelm too soon. He should be delayed until the player has actually left the city, which is when the courier will begin tracking the player down to deliver the note. (Bug #19498)</li>
<li>Broken Oar Grotto should not be made available for use by Preemptive Strike (DLC1RH03) because the location does not respawn. Other non-respawning locations are already blocked in that quest. (Bug #19497)</li>
<li>Smooth Jazbay (FreeformSarethiFarm) could leave behind the objective to collect Jazbay Grapes due to calling the objective completion before the final item swap is done. (Bug #19451)</li>
<li>Inheritance (WIKill03), An Enemy's Gratitude (WIKill04), WIKill05, and Revenge: Hired Thugs (WIKill06) may not be able to start and populate various aliases due to the aliases all not allowing reserved actors to fill them. (Bug #19438)</li>
<li>Taarie, Balimund, Muiri, Ghorza, Revyn Sadri, Filnjar, Quintus Navale, Dravynea, and Moth gro-Bagol will no longer accept investments once they're married to the player due to the way the vendor factions change. (Bug #19858)</li>
<li>An intimidation topic option in Hunting the Monster (DLC1RH04) did not have the brawl quest property defined, resulting in a broken call to the brawling system. (Bug #19555)</li>
<li>Naked NPCs should no longer chastise the player for also being naked. (WICommentNaked) (Bug #19503)</li>
<li>The following scene quests in Rorikstead had incorrect actors assigned to aliases, which would prevent them from running: RoriksteadSceneJouaneEnnis1, RoriksteadSceneJouaneErik1, RoriksteadSceneJouaneLemkil1, RoriksteadSceneJouaneReldith1, RoriksteadSceneMralkiErik02, RoriksteadSceneRorikEnnis1, RoriksteadSceneRorikErik1, RoriksteadSceneRorikLemkil1, RoriksteadSceneRorikReldith1. (Bug #19714)</li>
<li>Hired thugs sent to beat up the player for stealing from people (WIAddItem03) can be killed or turned hostile before speaking to the player. When this happens the quest becomes permanently stuck and unable to advance, leaving the dead bodies of the thugs lying around forever. (Bug #19826)</li>
<li>Due to a rare inventory reference corruption bug, it was possible to attempt to place an Aetherium Shard on the pedestal at Bthalft and have it instead remove a different item from the player's inventory. Lost to the Ages (DLC1LD) will then become stuck and the player will be unable to open the entry into the forge. The removed item is permanently lost, and the shards are then permanently stuck in the inventory. To work around this, the DLC1LD_AetheriumPedestal script has been altered to deal directly with the MiscObject base forms instead of using alias reference checks. This allows the quest to continue on with proper activation of the pedestal and removal of the actual Aetherium Shards. This WILL NOT fix the underlying inventory reference bug that caused this. It is only a workaround to prevent this quest from getting blocked by it. (Bug #19803)</li>
<li>Radiant world encounters for the Companions (WERJ10, WERJ11, WERJ12) cause the involved members to get pulled out of their normal crime factions which will then cause them to become permanently hostile to player werewolves even though they are not supposed to be. (Bug #19469)</li>
<li>Skill trainers were not all consistently offering training topics or refusal dialogue due to the responses being in a scrambled order. (DialogueTrainers) (Bug #19391)</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>MS14GhoruunEntrance: Trigger script did not have a secondary check to disable itself if the scene outside of Movarth's Lair never played properly. (Bug #19541)</li>
<li>PlayerBookShelfTriggerSCRIPT, PlayerBookShelfContainerScript: Several issues with bookshelves have been fixed with script updates provided by Adria:
 <ul>
  <li>Bookshelf inventory capacity sometimes expands beyond its actual limit.</li>
  <li>Activating one bookshelf sometimes caused the contents of another to vanish.</li>
  <li>Books can change positions on a shelf when they're not supposed to.</li>
  <li>Books placed on a shelf, taken by hand, then dropped may disappear from the game.</li>

<li>Road sign meshes for Morthal had a bad Y-offset, which caused them to appear out of place on poles. (Bug #19514)</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v2.1.3a (2015-08-04)</p>
<b>USKP Hotfix</b>
<ul>
<li>The quest following Jagged Crown was not triggering properly in cases where the crown was returned to Tullius when you were sent by him to get it.</li>
<li>The file path for the male iron armor fixes in version 2.1.3 was wrong. They were stored under an "m" folder when they belong in a "male" folder for those.</li>
<li>ClothesFarmClothes02 had a separated wrist due to the amulet changes made in Farm02Torso01AA. For whatever daft reason, the actual mesh is partitioned in such a way that the arms are in the amulet slot which is what caused them to break. This required an additional mesh fix to correct (meshes\clothes\farmclothes02\m\torso_0.nif, meshes\clothes\farmclothes02\m\torso_1.nif).</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">v2.1.3 (2015-07-12)</p>
<b>USKP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>02058EDE, 02058EDF: Beds previously added in the Windhelm East Empire Company Warehouse were mistakenly placed above the surface of the floor. One of the beds [02058EDE] also needed to be relocated since it was partially placed on an uneven part of the floor. The navmesh needed to be edited as a result. (Bug #19370)</li>
<li>Reverted edit to form 0010FF5D because it leaves behind a forever looping sound. The original bug should have been dealt with by commenting out the bad line in the script instead. (MG08BarrierRefScript) (Bug #19352)</li>
<li>When soul trapping a non-humanoid Actor that was set up as a ghost, and had the default ghost loot flag set, there was a possibility that all empty black soul gems and The Black Star would be permanently lost due to the way in which ghosts with the default loot flag handle swapping the items before turning into an ash pile. This problem has now been eliminated by using a dedicated dummy NPC in a USKP test cell so that these items can no longer become lost. (Bug #19297)</li>
<li>Drowned Sorrows (FreeformWinterholdC) was shutting down prematurely due to an unknown change that was made to the ending scene to terminate the quest. (Bug #19395)</li>
<li>Reverted changes to CWExiledSonsSandboxBrunwulfsHouse -- this package deliberately does not send Korir and family to the Palace of the Kings because there is not enough space for them there.</li>
<li>QF_dunStonehillBarrowQST_000CF915: Corrected an error that caused killing bandits in the quest area to open their inventories to the player. (Bug #19441)</li>
<li>Evette San stopped handing out free spiced wine to female players due to a script added by the USKP that later went missing. (Bug #19444)</li>
</ul>

<b>UDBP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>A navmesh connection on the Windhelm docks had become broken at some point and needed to be repaired.</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The "Blade" class (which Delphine is the only member of) was not properly configured to reflect the stats and skills she actually uses in the game. (Bug #19384)</li>
<li>The class governing normal Stormcloak guards (GuardSonsSkyrim) had incorrect attribute weight settings. (Bug #19384)</li>
<li>The class governing random Stormcloak soldiers (SoldierSonsSkyrimNotGuard) had incorrect attribute weight settings. (Bug #19384)</li>
<li>GuardOrc1H and GuardOrc2H had incorrect attribute weight settings.</li>
<li>EncClassPenitusOculatus incorrectly assigned points to heavy armor when all of the units wear light armor.</li>
<li>Corrected the skill allocations for CombatWitchblade, CombatSorcerer, and Blade to better match the skills of NPCs who used these classes.</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Susanna the Wicked has been added to the TGNoPickpocketFaction to prevent Fishing Jobs from being obstructed by Blood on the Ice. (Bug #19362)</li>
<li>Susanna the Wicked was never provided a proper burial urn in the Hall of the Dead. (Bug #19396) [NR]</li>
<li>Khajiit caravan members would join Forsworn and bandits in fighting the player if they witnessed the battles. This was due to the faction relationships being set up incorrectly. (Bug #19367)</li>
<li>Lortheim should sandbox in the Temple of Talos once the Empire has control of Windhelm. (Bug #19385)</li>
<li>Once A Blade in the Dark (MQ106) starts, Delphine should run her general sandbox package in the secret area of the Sleeping Giant. (Bug #19386)</li>
<li>Melaran should no longer assume Sybille's entire daily schedule if she's killed. Conditions were added to the alias AI packs to only run the sleep and sandbox parts for vampire NPCs. Melaran will perform his normal schedule except for the 4pm to midnight slot where he will hold court for the same time frame Sybille did. (Bug #19329)</li>
<li>The guards in Calcelmo's Tower accuse Aicantar of trespassing because they are not in the proper factions. (Bug #17836) [NR]</li>
<li>Lortheim had the incorrect outfit set (court wizard robe instead of monk robes).</li>
<li>Corrected Arnbjorn having a class that did not match his given weapon; also corrected his armor (DBArmorShortSleeve) being considered heavy despite having the ArmorLight keyword.</li>
<li>Urag gro-Shub was improperly set as a CombatScout by class rather than a CombatSorcerer.</li>
<li>Hakon One-Eye had not received the same fix as Gormlaith and Felldir to prevent pickpocketing.</li>
<li>Illia has been given a static spell list and flagged as unique to prevent an issue where her inventory would reset after she had been left alone for enough time. She's available as a follower and this would result in any items given to her by the player being lost when she resets. Also removed the leveled dagger from her inventory since she was receiving an identical leveled dagger in her alias in dunDarklightQST.</li>
<li>Corrected EncTGSummerset01Melee1HHighElfM not inheriting stats from its template, leaving all Summerset Shadows weaker than they were intended to be.</li>
<li>Jon Battle-Born was listed as Idolaf Battle-Born's son when dialogue suggests that they should be siblings.</li>
<li><s>It was not possible to invest in Grelka's shop in Riften.</s> [USLEEP 3.0.1]</li>

<li><s>It was not possible to invest in Madesi's shop in Riften.</s> [USLEEP 3.0.1]</li>
<li>Farm animals and player owned horses will no longer report crimes the player commits near them.</li>
<li>Corrected Orthjolf and Ronthil having the incorrect templates set (Orthjolf was set to use a missile template but had no bow; Ronthil received a bow during DLC1VQ08 but was set to a magic template).</li>
<li>Lord Harkon never wears his sword due to a faulty setting on his combat style. His essential instance (the one you never actually fight with) is now using a combat style that will make him wear it. (Bug #19427)</li>
<li>Corrected several male bandits that improperly had "opposite gender anims" set. [NR]</li>
</ul>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Several weapon draw and sheathe sounds were not set to the correct sound category and were audible even with the effects volume disabled in the UI. (Bug #18948)</li>
<li>Corrected Karliah beginning her explanation of the Agent of Strife with "this" instead of "the" (Sound/Voice/Skyrim.esm/FemaleUniqueKarliah/TG09_TG09KarliahInfosBranc_0004C2B4_2.fuz).</li>

<li>Bad collision on a hallway piece for Dawnguard's castle. (meshes\dlc01\dungeons\castle\lghalls\caslghallstair01.nif) (Bug #19009)</li>
</ul>

<b>Navmesh Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Hob's Fall Cave had a broken navmesh with two triangles twisted underneath the main grid which caused NPCs to become confused while navigating the cell. (Bug #19389)</li>
<li>Broken preferred pathing and several bad navmesh triangles have been corrected in IvarsteadExterior01 and IvarsteadExterior04. (Bug #19364)</li>
<li>Steamscorch Gully Mine in Kynesgrove has a broken navmesh making the back 1/3 of the mine largely inaccessible to the NPCs when they work there. (Bug #19350)</li>
<li>Preferred pathing errors between Largbashur and Riften, and between Riften and Fallowstone Cave, causes Yamarz to leave the road, then turn back to it while he's following you. (Bug #18511)</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixing WITavern revealed a secondary bug that caused Delphine's scene with Orgnar in the Sleeping Giant to fail, resulting in her being permanently stuck in her room. (Bug #19368)</li>
<li>The quest that restrains Ogmund (FreeformMarkarthMPostQuest) was not properly holding him in the stockade and was also not releasing him if the Stormcloaks took control of The Reach. (Bug #19344)</li>
<li>Repentance (dunDarklightQST) is never shut down once Illia agrees to join you as a follower. (Bug #19133)</li>
<li>Olava's greetings don't make sense in the order they're given in DialogueWhiterun. (Bug #19322)</li>
<li>After The Dainty Sload (TGTQ02) the Balmora Blue is not removed from the chest. (Bug #19340) [NR]</li>
<li>Irileth follows Balgruuf to High Hrothgar if Message to Whiterun (CW03) is running alongside Season Unending (MQ302), but she shouldn't do this because she will disrupt the proceedings. (Bug #19366)</li>
<li>Whiterun guards should not be talking about killing Imperials once the city has chosen a side in the war. (Bug #19315)</li>
<li>Eltrys' body is never properly cleaned up at the end of The Forsworn Conspiracy (MS01.) (Bug #19389) [NR]</li>
<li>After Fit for a Jarl (SolitudeFreeform02), Taarie's friendship rank with the player is never raised which then makes it impossible to marry her even though she's set up for marriage. (Bug #19403)</li>
<li>If the player joins the Stormcloaks (either initially or by defecting after Jagged Crown) the quest where the player can pick up free Imperial gear (CW01AOutfitImperial) is never shut down which leaves Beirand in a perpetual essential alias. (Bug #19402)</li>
<li>If the player defects to the Stormcloaks at the end of Jagged Crown (CW02A), Ulfric's closing lines that explain the significance of delivering an axe to Balgruuf will not be available like they are if you join the Stormcloaks normally. (Bug #19407)</li>
<li>Revyn Sadri stops offering training after marriage due to a bad dialogue condition check. (Bug #19390)</li>
<li>In Unfathomable Depths (MS04), From-Deepest-Fathoms has a dialogue line that was given a post process effect that was improperly used. The dialogue line containing it has been blocked off since it cannot be fixed. (Bug #19393)</li>
<li>During Missing in Action (MS09) the Gray-Mane house is never set temporarily to public access which results in the player being accused of trespassing. (Bug #19387)</li>
<li>In Blood on the Ice (MS11) it was possible to accuse Wuunferth without having taken possession of the amulet because the amulet and the butcher flyers both share the same script which was only setting a quest stage. Two tracking variables have been added to make sure that BOTH clues are required to make the accusation, as intended. (Bug #19281)</li>
<li>At the end of Discerning the Transmundane (DA04) Septimus Signus dissolves before completing the audio for his final line due to the ascension script being in the wrong scene phase fragment. (Bug #18698)</li>
<li>The following list of scenes would never, or very rarely, play because the quests did not allow reserved aliases: CaravanScene1, CaravanScene2, CaravanScene3, CaravanScene4, CaravanScene5, CaravanScene6, CaravanScene7, CaravanScene8, DialogueRiverwoodSceneA, DialogueRiverwoodSleepingGiantScene1, DialogueRiverwoodSleepingGiantScene2, DialogueRiverwoodLucansDryGoodsScene1, DialogueRiverwoodFamilyScene1, DialogueRiverwoodFamilyScene2, DialogueRiverwoodFamilyScene3, DialogueRiverwoodFamilyScene4, DialogueRiverwoodSceneAlvorGerdur, DialogueRiverwoodSceneSigridAlvor, DialogueRiverwoodSceneSigridEmbry, DialogueRiverwoodSceneSigridHilde, DialogueRiverwoodSceneEmbrySoldier, DialogueRiverwoodSceneSoldierHilde, DialogueRiverwoodSleepingGiantScene3, DialogueRiverwoodSleepingGiantScene4, DialogueRiverwoodSleepingGiantOrderDrinks, DialogueRiverwoodSleepingGiantScene5, DialogueRiverwoodSleepingGiantScene6, DialogueRiverwoodSceneSigridAlvor2, DialogueRiverwoodSceneGerdurHod, DialogueRiverwoodSleepingGiantScene7, DialogueRiverwoodSleepingGiantScene8. (Bug #19418)</li>
<li>DialogueWhiterunTempleTalkFarmer and DialogueWhiterunTempleTalkSoldier, two scenes set up to run in the Temple of Kynareth, were never set to the proper type of quest and were therefore missed when adding things to the Actor Dialogue Events for the temple. (Bug #19418)</li>
<li>63 scenes in Solitude were not properly flagged to allow reserved aliases and thus would never (or very rarely) play.</li>
<li>The following scenses in Saarthal are unlikely to play due to not allowing reserved aliases: DialogueSaarthalExteriorConvoScene1, DialogueSaarthalExteriorConvoScene2, DialogueSaarthalExteriorConvoScene3, DialogueSaarthalInteriorConvoScene1, DialogueSaarthalInteriorConvoScene2</li>
<li>Several quests in Whiterun were configured as Actor Dialogue Events but had not been properly configured to start the scenes they were meant to call.</li>
<li>Two quests at Snow-Shod Farm were configured as Actor Dialogue Events but had not been properly configured to start the scenes they were meant to call.</li>
<li>Three quests at the Bards College were configured as Actor Dialogue Events but had not been properly configured to start the scenes they were meant to call.</li>
<li>Three quests in the Ragged Flagon were configured as Actor Dialogue Events but had not been properly configured to start the scenes they were meant to call.</li>
<li>A quest in the Windhelm Palace was configured as Actor Dialogue Events but had not been properly configured to start the scene it was meant to call.</li>
<li>Three quests at the College of Winterhold were configured as Actor Dialogue Events but had not been properly configured to start the scenes they were meant to call.</li>
<li>Several quests in Morthal were configured as Actor Dialogue Events but had not been properly configured to start the scenes they were meant to call.</li>
<li>A quest in the Vylemar Inn was configured as Actor Dialogue Events but had not been properly configured to start the scene it was meant to call.</li>
<li>Several quests in Dragon Bridge were configured as Actor Dialogue Events but had not been properly configured to start the scenes they were meant to call.</li>
<li>Balgruuf's and Irileth's last lines in The World-Eater's Eyrie (MQ303) are barely audible and needed a sound override to be able to hear them. (Bug #19421)</li>
<li>During Laid to Rest (MS14) killing Alva will result in Hroggar and Lami dropping friendliness with the player even if Alva is killed after going hostile. (Bug #19404)</li>
<li>The scene where Angrenor and Rolff are picking on Suvaris when the player enters Windhelm the first time can get interrupted and cause the NPCs to become rooted to their start positions due to poorly designed variable checks. This has now been overhauled to prevent them from becoming stuck while still allowing the scene to play out normally if it's not interrupted. (Bug #19275)
<li>Corrected issues in CWMission04 where the enemy soldiers would stand around doing nothing while attacked, and where your allies would prematurely storm the fort if "Season Unending" had been completed. (Bug #18215)</li>
<li>Completing Tending the Flames (MS05) provides the player an unmarked boost to speechcraft skill advancement. This has now been made visible and given the name the Prima Game Guide called it (which is the only confirmed source of a name). "The Gift of Gab" will appear in your effects list once the quest is done. (Bug #19392)</li>
<li>Delphine and Esbern acquire duplicate inventory items along the way through the main quest. The duplicates have been commented out. (Bug #19383)</li>
<li>Occupants in Highmoon Hall tell the player they need to leave despite it being a public cell because their sleeping packages have "lock doors" and "warn before locking doors" checked when the other Jarl longhouses do not. (Bug #16831)</li>
<li>In DialogueGenericScene04, the "laughter" section displays a blank subtitle with the NPCs name due to the use of angle brackets which the UI parser eats. (Bug #19397)</li>
<li>Mjoll will repeat her line about being the first time in Windhelm due to the idle dialogue having no checks to see if she'd used it before. (Bug #19273)</li>
<li>Corrected Malacath's dialogue and the quest journal incorrectly stating that the player accepted Yamarz's offer in DA06 due to stage 100 being set regardless of the player's choice.</li>
<li>Corrected several of Sheogorath's hellos in DA15 never playing due to running GetQuestCompleted checks on quests that are never flagged as "completed."</li>
<li>Corrected two of Dervenin's hellos not only checking stages on the wrong quest, but also having no hour reset time, which caused them to block his other quest-related hellos.</li>
<li>Corrected one of Captain Lonely-Gale's hellos having erroneous checks on completion for Blood on the Ice (MS11).</li>
<li>Corrected two Windhelm palace scenes that could not play because Captain Lonely-Gale had been confused with Jorleif in the quest aliases. Also corrected Ulfric's dialogue to match.</li>
<li>Corrected a TGDialogue hello for Vex that was intended to allow talking to her during FreeformWinterholdC checking the wrong stage.</li>
<li>During the player's wedding ceremony, guests will no longer rush out the doors as soon as Maramal is finished speaking; they were intended to sandbox in the Temple afterwards, but the scene never started.</li>
<li>Corrected two of Jala's lines that were intended to appear based on the player's progress in MS07 but were instead conditioned on the hold's CW ownership.</li>
<li>Corrected one line of Delphine's in Season Unending (MQ302) which was improperly checking stages on MQPaarthurnax.</li>
<li>Corrected two of Keerava's rumors that were checking for the wrong quests to be completed.</li>
<li>Corrected Felldir the Old having no hit lines due to a misplaced speaker NPC setting on the dialogue.</li>
<li>Corrected Korir never using his quest-related goodbye in "The Helm of Winterhold" due to the GetIsID check running on Kraldar instead.</li>
<li>Corrected one of Brynjolf's goodbyes and one of his hellos missing the "random end" flag.</li>
<li>Corrected Dengeir never giving the introductory hello to "Dark Ancestor" if the player were above level 10; also corrected "Dark Ancestor" becoming unavailable if Dengeir is Jarl.</li>
<li>Corrected the "Fight! Fight!" line for not having enough gold to bet only appearing for Chief Burguk rather than all Orc chieftains.</li>
<li>Corrected Jon Battle-Born's initial greeting only playing for Nords if he were in the Whiterun worldspace when his version for non-Nords had no such restriction.</li>
<li>Corrected one of Eorlund Gray-Mane's lines only appearing for female players due to a erroneously copied GetPCIsSex check.</li>
<li>In MG03, corrected the quest journal stating that the player had been sent to Urag at the behest of Mirabelle Ervine when actually Arch-Mage Aren is the one who instructed the player to do so.</li>
<li>Corrected two Windhelm blacksmith scenes that apparently could not play because the alias fill type was incorrect.</li>
<li>Corrected all Thane quests (Favor250, Favor252, Favor253, and Favor254) not having "allow reserved" ticked on the steward's alias, which caused the quest objective to not point to the Jarl's steward.</li>
<li>If Vignar reinstates the player's Thaneship after Whiterun is taken for the Stormcloaks, he will no longer reward the player with a sword whereas Balgruuf gave the player an axe.</li>
<li>In "Under New Management," corrected Ravyn Imyan crossing the cistern during the ceremony due to an incorrect scene package.</li>
<li>Corrected some of Proventus Avenicci's dialogue in MQ201Party never appearing due to impossible GetTalkedToPC checks; changed to check relationship rank as their other dialogue did.</li>
<li>Corrected several combat taunts in MQ303 not having random flags or GetInCurrentLoc checks for Skuldafn, causing dragons everywhere to use just one of the taunts constantly while the quest was running.</li>
<li>Corrected one of Bassianus Axius' hellos being misordered, resulting in it never being heard.</li>
<li>Numerous dialogue topics in Solitude either had bad conditions or were missing random flags which caused them to fail.</li>
<li>Our good friend, Blood on the Ice (MS11 - Die in a fire you bastard) has had several more fixes applied in an effort to get it working properly:
 <ul>
  <li>When investigating Hjerim, the player will only be prompted to follow up on the clues if they have found both the amulet and a flyer (otherwise there was no indication that they both needed to be found, despite them both being necessary for quest completion).</li>
  <li>Removed MS11ButcherJournal2Script from both the Butcher's personal copy of the journal and journal volume #1; if the player had not read the journals, Viola would take them to Hjerim and help them find the secret room, which strongly suggests that only the journal's second volume should "count" for continuing the quest.</li>
  <li>In all instances where the player needed a "Beware the Butcher!" pamphlet to speak to someone, the new USKP variable is checked instead, as these items were not quest items and other items -- such as the journal -- only checked that the player had found them, not that they were being carried.</li>
  <li>When discussing the journal with Viola, the player's dialogue has been altered to no longer suggest that "the court mage" is the suspect, since this line of thought doesn't become evident until after speaking to Calixto about the amulet. Viola will still jump to accusing Wuunferth, due to the rumors she's heard about him.</li>
  <li>It is now necessary to speak to Calixto about the amulet to continue the quest and accuse or help Wuunferth; this is what sets the player on the court mage's trail and without Calixto's account, the amulet's presence means absolutely nothing.</li>
  <li>The steward and the Windhelm guards will point you to Calixto to discuss the amulet even if you've already spoken to Viola.</li>
  <li>Discussing the evidence with both Calixto and Viola is now necessary to accuse Wuunferth; the "speak to <Alias=AuthorityFigure>" objective is now delayed to reflect this.</li>
  <li>Fixed several dialogue branches that were linking to themselves.</li>
  <li>Added a walk away to Calixto's amulet-buying branch so that it's no longer possible to exit conversation with the quest marker still pointing to him once he's played his part.</li>
  <li>Corrected the topic prompts alternating between saying that the player had found "one of" Wuunferth's journals versus having found his journals (only one journal was actually necessary to continue the quest).</li>
  <li>Added two new responses for the steward and Wuunferth, in case the player tries to accuse the court mage without the amulet.</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>Gunmar and Sorine deliver their post greetings after Kindred Judgment more than once due to the "say once" bug. Tracking variables have been added to prevent them from doing so. (Bug #19363)</li>
<li>Corrected several of Serana's combat lines that were intended for dragons but were appearing when she fought anything due to misplaced "OR" conditions.</li>
<li>Hello topics for the occupants of Castle Volkihar were putting generic ones before their quest related ones, resulting in them being blocked.</li>
<li>Corrected Falx Carius' alert lines not having random flags.</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>TGDoorCloserTriggerScript: Activation command using the player reference causes any invisibility spells to abort. (Bug #19360)</li>
<li>MGRArniel03SContainerScript: OnMagicEffectApply event continues counting hits on the convectors when it should only register on the 16th hit. This then results in item duplication which can disrupt the associated quest. (Bug #19353)</li>
<li>DragonActorScript: Scenes for when the player kills a dragon and starts to absorb the soul are skipping dialogue due to the order of two statements in the OnDeath event. (Bug #19214)</li>
<li>dunMzinchaleftGateAttentionScript: Called activate on itself which resulted in a loop that the script VM eventually stops. (Bug #18588)</li>
<li>WERoad08LetterScript: Sanity check for reading it if the quest is already stopped. (Bug #18316)</li>
<li>MQ304LostSoulScript: Sanity check to prevent massive spam flow into the logs when the lost soul trigger returns a NONE. (Bug #14263)</li>
<li>dunProgressiveCombatScriptRefAlias: Sanity checks for the battle manager attack variables. (Bug #14369)</li>
<li>BYOHRelationshipAdoptionChildScript: Using EquipItem() and RemoveItem() along with SetOutfit() is redundant and can lead to inventory duplication. SetOutfit() already takes care of removing the relevant items. The script was also erroneously setting the sleep outfits instead of the normal ones.</li>
</ul>

<li>Dead seekers were not being properly removed from the game due to a script regression. (Bug #19313)</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The game setting value for intimidation of foolhardy NPCs was found to be WILDLY out of balance with the settings for cowardly, cautious, average, and brave NPCs. The values were in the sequence: 0.00, 0.50, 1.00, 1.50, and 100.00. They should instead be: 0.00, 0.50, 1.00, 1.50, and 2.00. fIntimidateConfidenceMultFoolhardy being set to 100.00 is why it was impossible to intimidate these NPCs. The setting required Speech skill values that exceeded what would ever be possible for a player to obtain in the game without the use of console commands. All NPCs previously edited to work around this issue have had their confidence levels restored to vanilla settings. (Bug #19173)</li>
<li>Leveled list lchardragonany lacked fire dragons at level 27 even though they exist and should have been in the list since all other levels have them. (Bug #19320)</li>
<li>Leveled list DLC2LCharDragonAny and DLC2LCharDragonAnyMQ06 lacked fire dragons at level 27 even though they exist and should have been in the lists since all other levels have them. (Bug #19320)</li>

<li>The Dragonborn DLC initialization script never adds Nordic arrows to the bandit leveled lists even though it added Nordic bows. (Bug #19338)</li>
</ul>

<b>Animation Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Casting spells with the left hand while riding a dragon was not always possible due to an incorrect related anim setting in the idle animation set that controls mounted combat. (Bug #19175)</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>

<li>NPC LvlThalmorMissile was not inheriting inventory from Thalmor base actors, causing them to equip with standard bandit gear instead. (Bug #19118)</li>

<li>Urag greets you as though you are in the Arcanaeum even when he's not currently there. (Bug #18993)</li>
<li>During The Book of Love (T02), Calcelmo's dialogue about the letter for Faleen does not drop away properly due to checking for a non-existent quest stage. (Bug #19052)</li>
<li>Trouble in Skyrim (CR04) could pick potential followers and hirelings as targets which then leads to brawls that take forever due to the high health that these NPCs get because they level when the player does. Brawls of sufficient length tend to risk turning into assaults the longer they run. (Bug #19155)</li>
<li>During Meet the Family (TG02B), Vex has two lines of intro dialogue which were not correctly linked up causing them to be skipped. (Bug #19176)</li>
<li>When arresting the player, guards do not use the dialogue they have when the player resists because the script to set the arrest mode was in the wrong part of each of the topic entries. (Bug #19174)</li>
<li>Similarly, when orcs at a stronghold try to arrest the player and they resist, they do not use their resist dialogue for the same reason. (Bug #19269)</li>
<li>During In My Time Of Need (MS08PrisonerSceneQuest) it is possible for NPCs who are not guards to run the scene when talking to the Alikir prisoner due to poor conditions on the alias check. (Bug #19187)</li>

<li>The control quest in Bthardamz (dunBthardamzQST) is never terminated when DA13 is completed. (Bug #19131)</li>
<li>Jonna will not run her tavern greeting (WITavern) because she has no server working for her so the quest never starts. The server alias has been marked optional and the scenes updated to make sure they don't try and run if the servers are dead. (Bug #19212)</li>
<li>During No News is Good News (SolitudeFreeform01), it was possible to order Captain Aldis to give you the information even if you were not of the proper rank in the Imperial Legion, or not a member of the Legion at all. (Bug #19300)</li>
<li>Lisbet's statue should not remain in her inventory after Lisbet's Missing Shipment (FreeformMarkarthE). (Bug #19121)</li>
<li>Brand-Shei's dialogue topic [DialogueRiftenBrandSheiBranchTopic] about the mystery of his birth no longer makes sense after the player has given him his journal. A condition check has been added to make this topic unavailable when FreefromRiften08 [stage 30] has been completed. (Bug #19070)</li>
<li>Hadring's dialogue topic [NightgateHadringOrcBranchTopic] about Balagog gro-Nolob no longer makes sense after the player has killed him in DB08. A condition check has been added so that the topic is unavailable if he is dead. (Bug #19302)</li>
<li>Fultheim's dialogue topic [DBNightgateFultheimCustomersBranchTopic] about Balagog gro-Nolob no longer makes sense after the player has killed him in DB08. A condition check has been added so that the topic is unavailable if he is dead. (Bug #19302)</li>
<li>Lilith Maiden-Loom can tell the player to visit the stables to see the horses even if you're already there. This is due to a bad dialogue condition that should have been set to have her say this when she's not there. (Bug #19323)</li>
<li>Several errors in dialogue handling for Delvin's special jobs and radiant quests have been corrected. (TGRShell) (Bug #19336)</li>
<li>If the player had joined the Thieves Guild before talking to Mjoll about them, they would still get a prompt indicating they were looking to join rather than already being a member. (Bug #19337)</li>
<li>Taron Dreth's mercenaries attack the player prior to dialogue finishing, which can make engaging the fight difficult (DLC1_WESC09). (Bug #19305)</li>
<li>After Destroying the Dawnguard (DLC1RV10), the corpses left over after the battle are never purged because there are other aliases that need to be cleared out so the corpses will be removed. (Bug #19170)</li>
<li>Two of Frea's combat taunts meant for the player could be used for any target she was attacking. (Bug #19280)</li>
<li>When arresting the player, Redoran guards do not use the dialogue they have when the player resists because the script to set the arrest mode was in the wrong part of each of the topic entries. (Bug #19270)</li>
<li>During Briarheart Necropsy (DLC2TTR5), the Briarheart body does not swap the body for the one with no heart inside due to an error in the quest specific perk script assigned to it. (Bug #19159)</li>
<li>When At the Summit of Apocrypha (DLC2MQ06) completes, the game does not increment the "questlines complete" stat. (Bug #19144)</li>

<b>Mesh and Texture Fixes</b>

<li>Raw pheasant meat had a collision radius too large which caused them to float over objects. (meshes\clutter\deadanimals\pheasantmeat01.nif) (Bug #19109)</li>
<li>The blank rubbing for the Thieves Guild quest, Firebrand Wine bottle & Firebrand Wine crate did not handle shadows and lighting correctly due to bad flags on their alpha transparency data.

<b>Race Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Female High-Elf vampires, male Redguard vampires, male Orc vampires, female Orc vampires, and male Imperial vampires were missing numerous warpaint textures and color settings that are present on their counterparts (and literally every other race entry too). (Bug #18977)</li>
<li>The Frostbite Spider race (FrostbiteSpiderRace) had the wrong melee impact sounds set. (Bug #19309)</li>
<li>ImperialRaceVampire did not have its unarmed impact data set which prevented the proper sound from playing like it should. This has been corrected by setting it to WPNzUnarmedImpactSet like all other races. (Bug #19303)</li>
<li>DLC2DremoraRace, which is used by the Dremora Merchant and Dremora Butler, did not have the head tracking animations box set so they would never head track the player or nearby NPCs etc. (Bug #19185)</li>
<li>DLC2BoarRace should not be capable of opening doors. (Bug #18965)</li>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>SF_DGIntimidateScene_0002C5B1: No sanity check to make sure the quest is still running when trying to set a stage. (Bug #19061)</li>
<li>dunHarmugstahlLeverScript: Script was not checking to see if the puzzle was complete before closing up the bars. It's in a NoReset location. This results in the dungeon becoming inaccessible once this happens. (Bug #19208) [NR]</li>
<li>CR11QuestScript: No sanity check against NONE locations for the Reset() call. (Bug #19103)</li>
<li>Soundtrap: The script did not take enable parented traps into account, which leads to errors caused by trying to enable or disable the objects outside the control of the parent markers. (Bug #19283)</li>
<li>SF_dunFaldarsToothBettingCage_00091444: Papyrus fragment could be run even if the quest wasn't running. As little sense as that makes. (Bug #19063)</li>
<li>DLC1VQ04EnterUndercroftTriggerScript: Trigger script fails to delete itself because it never disabled itself first. This results in Serana warping to your position and being forced as a follower if you enter the Volkihar Undercroft from the secret entry on the north side, regardless of whether or not Chasing Echoes is running. This fix will only fully update when the trigger is hit again, so expect one last instance of her being warped in. (Bug #19195)</li>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>When The Break of Dawn (DA09) runs scenes at Kikreath, it is possible for the two Meridia speeches to overlap each other. A delay has been inserted into the trigger script to prevent this from happening. (Bug #18711)</li>
<li>During The Taste of Death (DA11) if Eola is told to wait outside Reachcliff Cave, she will continually forcegreet. This is due to a missing stage to block this from happening. (Bug #18842)</li>
<li>Stormcloak Prisoners being escorted by Imperials were engaging in combat with the player if the soldiers were attacked. The prisoner now has a combat override package list assigned that should prevent them from engaging at all. (Bug #16762)</li>
<li>Narfi's responses when returning Reyda's necklace in The Straw that Broke (FreeformIvarstead02) are all thrown together in a nonsense fashion and had to be relinked in the proper setup.

<li>WIAddItem03: It should no longer be possible for dead, sleeping, or non-unique NPCs to hire thugs to come after you for stealing items from them. These changes will also prevent generic wilderness NPCs such as Forsworn and bandits from hiring thugs as well, which makes no sense at all. (Bug #17867)</li>
<li>WICastMagic04: The player should no longer get a "letter from a friend" when not in an inhabited area where it would make no sense to have even been seen doing it, much less by someone friendly to the player. (Bug #17867)</li>
<li><s>WICastMagic01: It should no longer be possible for the "invisible child" encounter to trigger if the player has not been detected, they are trespassing, or in combat. (Bug #17867)</s> [USSEP 4.1.8]</li>
<li>Two of the College students could not trigger the suspension quest if they were killed due to being marked as reserved aliases. Since the reservations are in a quest that can't be fixed, the alias in MGSuspensionQuest that holds the victim will be marked to allow reserved actors. (Bug #18972)</li>
<li>The Emperors Tower in Solitude is not properly locked out prior to To Kill an Empire (DB09) which can lead to breaking some of the triggers inside. (Bug #18997)</li>
</ul>

<b>Race Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Khajiit vampires were using an incorrect value for the left sided mounted combat angle (90 instead of -90). This error was introduced in an official patch to the game. (Bug #18906)</li>
<li>Imperial males, Redguard females, and both of their vampire counterparts were missing 22 of the 24 available warpaint options that all other races get. (Bug #18956)</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>

<li>C01AmbushSpaceEntranceTrigger: No check to make sure the quest was running before calling functions to manipulate aliases in it. (Bug #18961)</li>
</ul>

<b>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fort Sungard Muster had a pair of fish racks set up to hold weapons, plus some shields stuck to the walls.

<b>USKP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Completely reworked the fix for Gallows Rock and Driftshade Sanctuary. Gallows Rock is now a noreset zone, and its reservation in C00 will no longer get cleared when The Silver Hand (C03) is completed. Driftshade Sanctuary will be reserved to block radiant quests until after Purity of Revenge (C05) is complete. After that point it should switch over to regular bandits and then become available for use in standard radiant questing. (Bug #18760, Bug #18541)</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Masser and Secunda (the moons) were visible in the Soul Cairn if a save was loaded after launching the game from the desktop. This has now been corrected by using hidden moon glare settings only accessible via TES5Edit. (Bug #18321)</li>

<li>Activator object dunJaphetsFollyBombingArea was missing a Papyrus property for the Japhet's Folly quest (MS10). (Bug #18754) [NR]</li>
</ul>

<b>Location Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The 5 Glenmoril Witches in Glenmoril Coven were not marked as bosses, so the location would never get marked cleared if the first visit was during Blood's Honor (CR04). (Bug #18729)</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Mjoll will no longer offer her Riften specific topic if she's been recruited into the Blades. (Bug #18755)</li>
<li>Imperials should not still be trying to take Stormcloak prisoners (WE09) if the Stormcloaks won the war. (Bug #18775)</li>
<li>Glenmoril Coven will no longer be available for use in radiant quests due to the fact that the location can get reset by script and mess up the availability of the witch heads. (Bug #18730)</li>
<li>Return to Grace (SolitudeFreeform03) does not modify the relationship rank with Greta when completed, even though it should. (Bug #18677)</li>
<li>Harsh Master (FreeformShipsWindhelm) prematurely makes the boss NPC available to kill before Kjar actually offers the quest. (Bug #18661)</li>
<li>Amulet of the Moon (FreeformCaravansA) should no longer be blocked by picking a noreset location. The opening stage will force the dungeon to reset, which has been found to work even on noreset zones. (Bug #18119)</li>
<li>Kindred Judgment (DLC1VQ08) can stall if Stalf or Salonia have been dead long enough for their bodies to be purged from the game. Since they will always be dead at this point in the quest line, their aliases are now optional to prevent this from happening again.</li>
<li>During It's All In The Taste (DLC2RRFavor04) it was not possible to offer sujamma to Gjalund Salt-Sage if you were on Solstheim because the dialogue condition was not checking for both versions of him. (Bug #18700)</li>
<li>Kagrumez Gauntlet (DLC2KagrumezQST) could not cleanly handle moving the attackers into position due to a pair of bad navmesh islands that were not linked to anything. (Bug #18715)</li>

<li>DLC01SoulCairnTargetScript: Generates copies of the small light balls without checking to see if one already existed. Contributes to save bloat.

<p class="h">v2.0.9 (2015-02-07)</p>
<b>USKP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Reverted the fix for Elven Gilded Armor on Bug #15400. Turns out they are not using the wrong model data after all.</li>
<li>The script command to stop dunBloodletThroneQST was somehow placed into the wrong quest stage and was stopping it immediately upon starting it. (Bug #18621)</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>A bad navmesh border connection in cell 8,-3 has been corrected. NPCs navigating this area should no longer attempt to leave the road.</li>
<li>StaffEnchRevenant, StaffEnchDreadZombie did not carry the proper effect to generate ash piles when reanimated actors expired. (Bug #18524)</li>
<li>StaffEnchCommandDaedra, StaffEnchExpelDaedra lacked a magnitude which rendered the enchantment useless. (Bug #18524)</li>
<li>Bound Sword magic effects (BoundSwordFFSelf, BoundSwordMysticFFSelf, BoundSwordRightHandFFSelf) erroneously give 10 points per skill use instead of 1 point like all other bound weapon effects. (Bug #18374)</li>
<li>Staff and scroll enchantments for reanimation did not have the secondary effect needed to generate ash piles attached. (StaffEnchReanimateCorpse, StaffEnchRaiseZombie, StaffEnchDreadZombie, StaffEnchRevenant, RaiseZombieScroll, ReanimateCorpseScroll, RevenantScroll, DreadZombieScroll) (Bug #18270)</li>
<li>Class TrainerBlockExpert, used by Njada Stonearm, was mistakenly given 2 points in Pickpocket instead of Light Armor. She is a pure warrior, not a thief. As a member of the Companions, she never engages in anything that would fit with pickpocketing. (Bug #18648)</li>
<li>Class TrainerOneHandedExpert lacked light armor points. This class is exclusive to Athis, and his default inventory is light armor so the lack of light armor in the class profile did not fit. (Bug #18648)</li>
</ul>

<b>Animation Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Werewolves entering bleedout mode should not simply stand in place. This was due to an idle animation oversight that left the proper event out. (Bug #18560)</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Severio Pelagia did not have the required keyword to pay for leeks picked on his farm if you tried to sell them. (Bug #18569)</li>

<li>Azzada did not have the required keyword to pay for gourds picked on her farm if you tried to sell them. (Bug #18688)</li>
<li>Katla did not have the required keyword to pay for cabbage picked on her farm if you tried to sell some. (Bug #18687)</li>
<li>Aval Atheron's services faction had the wrong buy/sell type set for his inventory. (Bug #18516)</li>
<li>Ungrien's service faction had the wrong buy/sell type set. (Bug #18515)</li>
<li>Marise Aravel's service faction had the wrong buy/sell type set. (Bug #18515)</li>
<li>Lucan, Camilla, and Hod all lacked proper AI package flags for their visits to the Sleeping Giant Inn. (Bug #18496)</li>
<li>The ghosts in Forelhost generate the wrong kind of ash pile when they are killed. (Bug #18337) [NR]</li>
<li>Zaria was not assigned to the Falkreath crime faction, resulting in her not reporting crimes against her properly. Strangely, this also prevents her from counting toward helping people in Falkreath as well. (Bug #18302)</li>
<li>Alva will no longer return to Morthal and cause disruption in the city after Laid to Rest (MS14) is completed. (Bug #18396)</li>
<li>Klimmek's sandbox package outside in Ivarstead had no activity flags set. (Bug #18623)</li>

This caused them to have no second weapon for dual wield use even though their configurations clearly called for this. They also lacked standard Thalmor random loot because of this as well. (Bug #18647)</li>
<li>EncThalmor02Melee1HMShield, EncThalmor03Melee1HFShield, EncThalmor03Melee1HMShield, EncThalmor04Melee1HFShield, EncThalmor04Melee1HMShield, EncThalmor05Melee1HFShield, and EncThalmor05Melee1HMShield lacked the standard Thalmor random loot. (Bug #18647)</li>
<li>EncThalmor02Melee1HFShield lacked a shield. (Bug #18647)</li>
<li>The tame skeevers (BYOHHouseSkeeverTame) were not processing the intended script they'd been given because the template data was marked to override it from the parent - which has no script. This leads to a repeating infestation of skeevers, with a new tame one spawned every time. An annoyance as well as a source of save bloat. Existing tame skeevers will not be able to be removed unless you kill them yourself. (Bug #18617)</li>
</ul>

<li>The hooded version of the archmage robes should not allow circlets to be worn, like all other hooded items. (Bug #18216)</li>
<li>Staff of Magnus should now properly drain magicka and health from the target. (Bug #18443)</li>
<li>Ildari's Robes (DLC2IldariRobes) were carelessly duplicated from a playable set of Telvanni Robes and should not have been allowed to be looted by the player due to the sequence where her heart gets ripped out. (Bug #17930)</li>
<li>The following food items lacked vendor keywords or had incorrect vendor keywords: DLC2FoodAshHopperLeg, DLC2FoodAshHopperMeat, DLC2FoodBoarMeat, and DLC2FoodHorkerAshYamStew. (Bug #18332)</li>
</ul>

<b>Location Fixes</b>
<ul>

<li>The Thalmor Embassy Barracks was not marked as owned by the Thalmor faction, making it possible to enter and steal everything inside without penalty. (Bug #18604)</li>

<b>Navmesh Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Bad preferred navmesh paths in Whiterun appear to have caused Fralia to enter her home through the wrong door during Missing in Action, and may have contributed to why Belethor routinely enters his shop from the rear door for no apparent reason. In both instances, the preferred door was marked on the rear side of the building. (Bug #18616, Bug #16301)</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Stenvar could not be rehired during the 24hr rehire window due to bad condition checks on his dialogue. (Bug #18712)</li>
<li>After Danica tells the player to go to Eldergleam Sanctuary in The Blessings of Nature (T03), Maurice would still run his scene with her because the dialogue script was evaluating his AI before stopping the scene. (Bug #18570)</li>
<li>Ghosts who are also bandits should no longer attempt to use combat taunts intended for bandits that ghosts don't have recorded audio for. (Bug #16964)</li>
<li>Dismissing Erik the Slayer as a follower after he's been recruited as a blade still plays dialogue saying he's returning to Rorikstead even if this is not where he'll be going. (Bug #18237)</li>
<li>The Boethiah Cultist who attacks you in a random encounter (WEDA02Cultist) does not become hostile until he's been very close to the player for some time. An alias property needed to be adjusted to make sure he turns hostile upon gaining line of sight to the player. (Bug #18576)</li>
<li>Revealing the Unseen (MG06) will not start if Sergius Turrianus is killed prior to the quest. (Bug #18563)</li>
<li>Looting the locket from Linwe blocks displaying the objective to burn the Summerset Shadows banner during quest Summerset Shadows (TGTQ04). (Bug #18551)</li>
<li>Salty Sea-Dogs (FreeformShipsDawnstar) was not supposed to have allowed the Fine-Cut Void Salts to be available to pick up prior to Captain Wayfinder telling you about them. (Bug #18422)</li>
<li>Ysolda will no longer hold the mammoth tusk forever once you've given it to her in Rare Gifts (Favor110). (Bug #18342)</li>
<li>During A Night To Remember (DA14), Ysolda would not properly forcegreet the player to talk about the ring because she had no proper AI packages for this like all the other NPCs in the quest. (Bug #18365)</li>
<li>In A Chance Arrangement (TG00) Brynjolf can comment about the player sniffing out his scheme at the north gate even if they never actually entered the city that way. (Bug #18595)</li>
<li>General Tullius has a line cut off just after Alduin lands to attack Helgen. (Bug #18615)</li>
<li>In Blood on the Ice (MS11 - Talos, SMITE THIS QUEST) it was possible to accuse Wuunferth of necromancy without ever having read any of the available journal pages or taken the amulet from Hjerim. You can now no longer get him arrested OR confront him directly unless you've done this, which is what the scripting shows was supposed to have been done all along. (Bug #18594)</li>
<li>After Forsworn Conspiracy (MS02) any prisoners you killed will not have their corpses purged properly because DialogueCidhnaMine has them in aliases. These aliases will now clear as each prisoner dies so their corpses won't linger forever. (Bug #17184)</li>
<li>Mine or Yours (FreeformShorsStone01) does not display a quest pointer as intended due to checking the wrong conditions for the objective alias. (Bug #18649)</li>
<li>The objective "Become a full member of the Thieves Guild" will now be removed from the journal once the player speaks to Vex about the unusual gems after joining the guild. (Bug #18635)</li>
<li>Romlyn Dreth is not given prison clothing like all other prisoners once he's sent to jail. (Bug #18634)</li>
<li>Jarl Laila should no longer greet the player as though they've never spoken once they've met. (Bug #17225)</li>
<li>Brother Verulus cannot be persuaded to follow the player in The Taste of Death (DA11) because the speech check was being done on the wrong target. (Bug #18667)</li>
<li>The troll created for the Dawnguard attack on Castle Volkihar during Kindred Judgment (DLC1VQ08) is never removed from the attack area if it survives. (Bug #18386) [NR]</li>
<li>The topic used to rehire a hireling within 24 hours had no topic prompt and was showing "..." instead.</li>
<li>During Deathbrand (DLC2dunHaknirTreasureQST), the Rieklings at Haknir's Shoal do not disable once the quest has advanced to Gyldenhul Barrow. These Rieklings will now be properly disabled once the player has reached that point of the quest. (Bug #17984)</li>
<li>USKP fixes for dismissing Onmund have been carried over. (Bug #18618)</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>QF_dunLostValleyRedoubtQST_000B0F5B has a conditional variable in it that a scene relies on, but the script was never compiled with the Conditional attribute.</li>
<li>T02DinyaStopPrayingScript had no sanity check for when the alias might be empty. (Bug #18655)</li>
<li>DLC1TrapPoisonBloom: Configured an OnReset() event to handle properly respawning the poison blooms when their cells reset. (Bug #18465)</li>
<li>DLC2RR03ExitTriggerScript: No sanity checking to make sure the quest is actually running before trying to manipulate an alias in it. (Bug #18684)</li>
</ul>

(meshes\actors\character\_1stperson\behaviors\0_master.hkx, meshes\actors\character\behaviors\0_master.hkx)</li>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>dunHarmugstahlAdventurer has no crime faction assigned and will therefore talk to werewolves and/or vampire lords when this should not be allowed. (Bug #18124)</li>
<li>The housecarl for Whiterun should not attend the negotiations at High Hrothgar. She only does due to a lack of conditions on her AI pack to guard the Jarl. (Bug #17860, Bug #14267)</li>
<li>The housecarl for Whiterun should also not shadow the Jarl to Kodlak's funeral for the same reasons. (Bug #17860)</li>
<li>Bralsa Drel should begin working the mine in Raven Rock once it's back in operation but her market package did not have the appropriate condition set. (Bug #18061)</li>
<li>Captain Veleth was not a member of the IsGuardFaction faction which prevented him from arresting the player for crimes even though he has all of the necessary dialogue. (Bug #17994)</li>
<li>Baldor was incorrectly configured to buy any type of item when he should only be dealing in blacksmith items. (Bug #17927)</li>
</ul>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Bound weapons should not be playing draw and sheathe sounds when the spells are cast. (Bug #17214)</li>
<li>Ingjard had no available dialogue option for blocking being taken as a follower if the player is a vampire. Two entries were created and her only available appropriate line was copied to fill in the gap. (sound\voice\Unofficial Dawnguard Patch.esp\femalecondescending\DLC1Dialog_DLC1DialogueHun_000A3E34_1.fuz, sound\voice\Unofficial Dawnguard Patch.esp\femalecondescending\DLC1Dialog_DLC1DialogueHun_000A3E35_1.fuz) (Bug #17710)</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Mythic Dawn hoods were clipping with circlets worn underneath. (Bug #18008)</li>
<li>Keening (MGRKeening) could not be equipped by followers due to a flag meant to keep NPCs from using the item. However this version of the weapon is meant to be played and only appears to have the flag due to a duplication error when the weapon was created. (Bug #17861)</li>
<li>Kerah's chest and Jonna's chest lacked the leveled list for the Master Trader perk. (Bug #18115)</li>
<li>Amulet of The Gargoyle and Amulet of Bats did not have the female weight sliders enabled on their armor add-on records. [DLC1VampireAmulet01AA, DLC1VampireAmulet03AA] (Bug #17978)</li>
<li>Ancarion's merchant chest was using the wrong leveled list for gold so he would only have some if the player was in the Thieves Guild. (Bug #17943)</li>
<li>Vendor chests for Garyn and Geldis lacked the Master Trader perk list. (Bug #17995)</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Spouse dialogue saying they're starting a new store repeats itself even though the "say once" flag is checked. A script variable has been added to block this after the first use as a workaround to the "say once bug". (Bug #18069)</li>
<li>Gularzob can be killed at any point prior to Cursed Tribe (DA06) which makes the entire ending make no sense at all since he is named as tribe leader by Malacath. He will now be protected with an essential alias until DA06 is complete. If DA06 is currently running when this update is applied, it will not take effect. (Bug #17701)</li>
<li>College of Winterhold lectures can abort immediately after starting if any of the audience members are dead. The lectures have all been flaged to abort only if the person GIVING the lecture is somehow dead. (Bug #17845)</li>
<li>Ill Met By Moonlight (DA05) was not shutting down properly if the player chose to kill Sinding and skin him for the Savior's Hide. (Bug #18175)</li>
<li>On Nazir's final contract for the Dark Brotherhood (via DarkSideContractDialogue), approaching Safia and talking to her does not turn her hostile as expected because the dialogue scripting is not raising her aggression value along with starting combat. (Bug #18157)</li>
<li>If Dampened Spirits (TG03) has started and then the Battle of Whiterun is completed, Caius will show up instead of Sinmir which then breaks the scene and caused the remainder of the Thieves Guild quest line to stall. (Bug #18073)</li>
<li>In Under New Management (TGLeadership), if you leave the cell before talking to Brynjolf, the quest will become blocked and you cannot complete it. Karliah becomes stuck in the Cistern this way and never leaves. This will deny the proper rewards as well. All due to a bad quest stage check on Brynjolf's dialogue. (Bug #17774)</li>
<li>The "KeyBandit" alias in dunRaldbtharQST was mistakenly carrying a key to the "Irkngthand Consortium" which does not exist. He should have been carrying the Raldbthar key. (Bug #17840) [NR]</li>
<li>During Blood on the Ice (MS11) (/assassinate MS11), Calixto would prematurely kill the last victim in the quest due to incorrect conditions placed on the AI packages and scene actions. (Bug #17973, Bug #18019)</li>
<li><s>When completing Kolskeggr Mine (FreeformKolskeggrA) you are expected to report back to Pavo. The barracks was not marked as a public area though and you'd be accused of trespassing when entering to talk to him. (Bug #18200)</s> [USSEP 4.1.8]</li>
<li>Random thief encounters (WERJ02) that led to combat would result in the thief sheathing their weapon before pulling it back out to attack due to timing issues with where the StartCombat() call was placed in the quest stage. (Bug #17865)</li>
<li>If Brelas is freed from prison in the Embassy during Diplomatic Immunity (MQ201) but Malborn dies there, she will run to Windhelm and then promptly be disabled. This happens in an unrealistic manner. Her package is now being redirected to the marker along the Morrowind border that she'd normally use when accompanying Malborn. It has also been given a safeguard condition to prevent it from running if Malborn is alive and in Windhelm. (Bug #18217)</li>
<li>Killing the two Hagravens at Lost Valley Redoubt (dunLostValleyRedoubtQST) before they can raise the Briarheart results in the bodies remaining forever because the quest never terminates. (Bug #17671)</li>
<li>The Afflicted encounter (WEJS14) that leads to The Only Cure (DA13) was checking stages on the wrong quest in the event manager which caused the encounter to spawn repeatedly until the player went to see Kesh. (Bug #17360)</li>
<li>During Laid to Rest (MS14), Alva is supposed to be removed from the hold's crime faction but the script call was doing it wrong. (Bug #18226)</li>
<li>The combat taunt "You won't leave Skyrim alive!" should only be played when the battle is taking place in Skyrim. (Bug #17172)</li>
<li>Dismissing Onmund as a follower after he's been married or recruited as a blade still plays dialogue saying he's returning to the College when this is not where he'll be going. (Bug #18227)</li>

<p class="h">v2.0.7 (2014-09-27)</p>
<b>USKP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The failsafe added in USKP 2.0.5 for Brelyna's Practice (MGRAppBrelyna01) was using the wrong methods to make sure the player had the effect which resulted in the spell being added to the player's Illuison spells. The spell will be removed upon starting the game with USKP 2.0.7 if the player has it, and it will also shut down the quest that gets started when the effect of the spell finishes. (Bug #17133)</li>
<li>Collision issues on the two jeweled goblet meshes fixed in USKP 2.0.5 have been tweaked again. The origin point for the mesh was incorrect, which was causing the whole thing to bug out. (Bug #16848, Bug #17295)</li>
<li>A duplicated tempering recipe for the Masque of Clavicus Vile that had been added by the USKP was removed. (Bug #17552)</li>
</ul>

<b>UDGP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Repositioned the trigger fix for Agmaer in Dayspring Canyon so that he won't outpace the player to the scene triggers further ahead of the starting point. (Bug #17187)</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The Bound Bow enchantment for Oblivion Binding (BoundBowEnchantment) had an incorrect magnitude setting of 50. It should be 99 like all of the other bound weapon enchantments. (Bug #17134)</li>
<li>Water planes in dungeons allow the player to slip through at the borders when more than one are used to make a large body of water. This causes problems in Broken Oar Grotto, Reachwater Rock, Robber's Gorge, and Purewater Run. The extra water planes have been disabled, with one water plane being scaled up to cover the area the regular ones were. The player will no longer slip through the border gaps and "fall" while in the water. (Bug #17296)</li>
<li>The location data for Soljund's Sinkhole did not have any of the necessary Civil War keywords set to be able to do the garrison swaps at the correct times. (Bug #17247)</li>
<li>A large section of the navmesh in Avanchnzel Boilery was below the walkways which would cause any creatures spawned in the affected section to fall under the walkway and become inaccessible. (Bug #17246)</li>
<li>A section of the path up to Throat of the World (ThroatOfTheWorldPath01) needed to be added to the location data for Throat of the World to prevent getting a "Letter From a Friend" when using shouts on the way up. (Bug #17245)</li>
<li>Fallowstone Cave had an invalid form ID set for its weather region. The correct one has now been assigned. It appears that the original region intended for the dungeon was deleted without resolving the data. (Bug #17149)</li>
<li>The north cell at Half-Moon Mill was not assigned to the Half-Moon Mill location data.</li>
<li>Wall of Flames, Wall of Frost, and Wall of Storms (HazardWallofFireSpell, HazardWallofFrostSpell, and HazardWallOfShockSpell) do not inflict the stated amount of damage the spell descriptions call for. Rather than 20 points, they are supposed to do 50 points of damage, which is in line with other similar expert level spells. (Bug #17365)</li>
<li>The Steel Smithing perk does not affect weapons of the Imperial material type, despite them being made of steel and also despite Imperial armors being affected by the perk. (Bug #17364)</li>
<li>Load screen TownMorthal02 has been adjusted to point to a mesh for a Hjaalmarch shield which was originally intended to be used on this screen. The generic battle axe is a placeholder mesh that was never properly swapped out. (meshes\loadscreenart\loadscreenhjaalmarchshield.nif) (Bug #17123)</li>
<li>Load screen CreatureHorseAndRider has been adjusted to point to the intended mesh rather than the other generic horse mesh which is already used by another screen. (meshes\loadscreenart\loadscreenhorse_and_rider.nif) (Bug #17123)</li>
<li>The missing load screen for the Tower Stone has been created. All other doom stones have load screens, and this one was supposed to get one too. (meshes\loadscreenart\loadscreendstower01.nif) (Bug #17123)</li>
<li>Widow's Watch Ruins did not have the proper location keywords to mark it as a clearable Hagraven nest. (Bug #17666)</li>
<li>Some navmesh issues around the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun have been corrected to keep NPCs from trying to walk through rocks and buildings. (Bug #17670)</li>
<li>The "hazard" effect used by the Guardian Circle spell (GuardianCircleTurnHazard) was not set to the correct duration. This would cause the visuals to disappear before the spell had actually expired. (Bug #17587)</li>
<li>Chaurus pods hit by Unrelenting Force would not break despite causing the chauruses within to spawn. (Bug #17540)</li>
<li>The Frost Stream spell (DLC2FrostStreamEffect) was erroneously set to use fire magic sound effects instead of frost. (Bug #17117)</li>
</ul>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>One of the female NPCs in Bthardamz mispronounces Orchendor's name. (sound\voice\Skyrim.esm\FemaleEvenToned\dunBthardamzQST__00083FF8_1.fuz) (Bug #17358)</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Corpulus Vinius (or his replacement if dead) would sometimes end up sitting on the barstools in front of the counter due to an AI pack radius that was too large. (Bug #17284)</li>
<li>The guards for the Imperial side in Dragon Bridge were not named consistently (Imperial Soldier vs Haafingar Guard). (Bug #17266)</li>
<li>The two Imperial guards who stand watch outside Castle Dour should be named "Imperial Soldier" instead of "Solitude Guard" as they are not wearing city guard uniforms. (Bug #17253)</li>
<li>Numerous city, town, and hold guards were not flagged to respawn. This could lead to the eventual depopulation of the entire guard force in the affected areas over time. (Bug #17241) [NR]</li>
<li>Gralnach does not go indoors at night with his mother, and will often be found standing around outside the house doing nothing. (Bug #17235)</li>
<li>TreasCorpseGuardRiften01 and TreasCorpseGuardRiften02 were inconsistently named "Riften Guard" when they're not actually dead in Riften. They will now appear as "Rift Guard" like the other living hold guards. (Bug #17194)</li>
<li>TreasCorpseCWImperialFemale and TreasCorpseCWImperialMale will now be appropriately labeled as "Imperial Soldier" instead of just "Corpse". (Bug #17194)</li>
<li>TreasCorpseCWSonsFemale and TreasCorpseCWSonsMale will now be appropriately labeled as "Stormcloak Soldier" instead of just "Corpse". (Bug #17194)</li>
<li>The player's horse can get attacked by random hunters and/or their own followers due to incomplete faction relationships. PlayerHorseFaction is now allies with CurrentFollowerFaction and DunPlayerAllyFaction. (Bug #17141)</li>
<li>The dog found in Redoran's Retreat (EncBanditDog) was not set to respawn along with the occupying bandits. This will also affect Faldar's Tooth and Brinewater Grotto. (Bug #17138)</li>
<li>Ghostly actors are not all immune to disintegration with shock spells. The following actors have been given the correct keywords to prevent disintegration, as well as correcting their lack of keywords to denote them as undead and ghosts: White Stag, Subjugated Ghost, Ghost Adventurer, Ghost (this includes a number of randomly generated encounter actors), Yngvild Ghost, Dunmer Ghost, 
Nightingale Ghosts, Companion Ghost, Dragon Cultist, Spectral Assassin, Spectral Warhound, Conjure Familiar (Wolf), Dragon Priest, Wispmother, Wisp, Ice Wraith, Vilkas's Wolf Spirit, Farkas's Wolf Spirit, Kodlak's Wolf Spirit, Player's Wolf Spirit, Guardian Troll Spirit, Mudcrab Guardian Spirit, Mammoth Guardian Spirit, Sabre Cat Guardian Spirit, Skeever Guardian Spirit, Ursine Guardian, Potema's Remains, Arniel's Shade, Jyrik Gauldurson, Sigdis Gauldurson. (Bug #17066)</li>
<li>Chickens at the unique necromancer encounter outside of Ivarstead will no longer respawn. They have been replaced with a non-respawning duplicate of the normal chickens. (Bug #17237)</li>
<li>Riften guards will practice in the barracks yard, but they draw their weapons before arriving there and stalk through the city in a bit of a silly display. All of the GuardRiftenPractice* packages, as well as RiftenHarraldPracticeDummy12x7, will no longer have the "Weapon Drawn" flag. (Bug #16763)</li>
<li>Dravynea did not have any spells to use in combat despite being a mage. (Bug #14740)</li>
<li>Jouane Manette did not have any spells to use in combat despite being a mage. (Bug #14740)</li>
<li>4 of the Pit Wolves at Cragslane Cavern were somehow getting out of their cages prior to actually visiting the area. A copy of the wolf actor being used has been made, and the 4 references replaced with this copy. The copy has an AI pack to hold them in place until the cage doors are open. The cage doors also now have a script to update their status so the wolves will go hostile once free. (Bug #17366)</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The impact sound set for bow bashing (WPNBashBowImpactSet) was missing several entries for various materials, causing bows to simply make no sound at all when bashed against them. (Bug #17244)</li>
<li>Gourds did not have the VendorItemFood keyword which prevented them from being bought and sold at food vendors. (Bug #17242)</li>
<li>When mined, geode veins were delivering a message saying the "ore" vein had been depleted even though it should be a "geode vein". (Bug #17177) [NR]</li>
<li><s>FarmhouseWindMill and FarmhouseWindMillWR should not have activator text because the player cannot actually use these. They are powered by the attached windmills. (Bug #17124)</s> [Official Patch 1.6.1130]</li>
<li>Barricade object StockadeBarricade01ActivatorLight_SN did not have the sound properties set, resulting in log errors whenever they were damaged. (Bug #17348) [NR]</li>
<li>Aval Atheron's vendor chest (MerchantWindhelmAvalAtheronChest) did not contain the proper assortment of items to reflect what's on display at the stand. (Bug #17368)</li>
<li>Object "DeerPelt" uses the same model as the recently fixed Elk hides, so it will now display as "Elk Pelt". (Bug #17367)</li>
<li>Potion of Ultimate Stamina had the wrong model assigned to it: "PotionFortifyStamRateExtreme.nif" instead of "PotionStaminaExtreme.nif". (Bug #17716)</li>
<li>Imp Stools in the greenhouse modules (BYOHHouseIngrdMushroom04) had no harvest sound set. (Bug #17839)</li>
<li>Bound daggers did not have the correct block, equip, and uneqip sounds set. They're supposed to match those of daedric daggers. (Bug #17207)</li>
<li>Two of the 3 playable versions of Miraak's sword (DLC2MKMiraakSword1 and DLC2MKMiraakSword2) did not have the unique impact sound set. (Bug #17157)</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Couriers sent to deliver notices to the player do not handle crimes committed against them. The alias in WICourier has been given the script which assigns crime factions based on where the courier is being sent. (Bug #17243)</li>
<li>Grosta's topic to ask about what happened to Leifnarr (FreeformHeartwoodMill) should not be available until she's actually mentioned him by name. (Bug #17204)</li>
<li>Killing Atar prior to receiving the quest in Karthwasten (FreeformKarthwastenA) could leave open the possibility of speaking to Ainethach and then being directed to Atar's corpse. This was due to the garrison reset calls in stages 100, 200, and 300 being processed before the Stop call and stalling Papyrus. (Bug #17251)</li>
<li>The top floor of Goldenglow Estate needed to be marked as a public area so Aringoth would not accuse the player of trespassing during Loud and Clear (TG02) (Bug #17350)</li>
<li>Clinton Lylvieve's topic about his goat should not be available if Lucky is dead. (Bug #17271)</li>
<li>Detection dialogue while at the Thalmor Embassy for Diplomatic Immunity (MQ201ThalmorEmbassy) was conditioned improperly for detecting Argonians or Khajiit if the player was wearing the Thalmor disguise robes. (Bug #17269)</li>
<li>During In My Time Of Need (MS08) Saadia needs to have her package stack evaluated to get her to break off from listening to Heimskr's sermon once the Alik'r have told you they're looking for Redguard women. (Bug #17206)</li>
<li>Alias dunWhiteRiverWatch_Captive on dunMasterQST, which is used for tracking various things in miscellaneous unmarked dungeon quests, needed to be marked as optional to prevent Papyrus errors. (Bug #17307)</li>
<li>If the player first visits Whiterun after 8pm and before 5am, then hangs around outdoors until after sunrise, Heimskr would approach his shrine but not begin preaching due to an error in the story manager. The event was time locked to only start his preaching quest between 5am and 8pm - but this proved to be an unnecessary restriction. Everyone's favorite Talos priest will now preach as intended even if your first visit to the city is in the middle of the night. (Bug #17292)</li>
<li>Rannveig's Fast dungeon quest (dunRannveigQST) never shuts down when Sild dies. (Bug #17137)</li>
<li>The NPCs in the initial scene for Waking Nightmare (DA16) do not properly head track who they are speaking to. (Bug #17103)</li>
<li>Something caused Vex's radiant Thieves Guild quests to stop cycling the keyword data, eventually causing her to run out of jobs. (Bug #17349)</li>
<li>When going to Vex or Delvin for new jobs, the topic to have them introduce you to what each type of job will run even if you've already heard it before due to the bug with Say Once topics introduced in Patch 1.6.</li>
<li>Challenging Hofgrir to a brawl (FreeformRiften19) and not having the money to offer up will result in the player being unable to come back and challenge him later. The dialogue script was setting a quest stage that has no available dialogue option. (Bug #17402) [NR]</li>
<li>Enchanting Pick-Up (MGR10) cannot be completed if the client dies after the quest starts, but before the player actually receives it. Sergius could end up sending you to pick up the item with no pointer to where to go, thus permanently stalling the quest. (Bug #17370)</li>
<li>When Good Intentions (MG04) starts up, the Arch Mage's quarters are supposed to be locked by the script. The door from the Hall of Elements is already handled, but the second door from the Arcaneum was not. Entering prior to being told to go there by Ancano will freeze out the quest, requiring you to exit the game via the console. (Bug #17369)</li>
<li>Two of Niranye's hello dialogue entries did not have conditions matching her AI schedule. (Bug #17440)</li>
<li>Octieve San has a hello topic that is no longer appropriate to use if Evette is dead. (Bug #17609)</li>

<li>A Dawnstar guard hello topic is no longer appropriate to use if Rustleif is dead. (Bug #17663)</li>
<li>One of the scenes in Candlehearth Hall (DialogueWindhelmCandlehearthScene1) should not play once Blood on the Ice (MS11) is finished. (Bug #17125)</li>
<li>The control quest used to detect when you shout at the bridge outside of the College of Winterhold (MGMainQuestBridge) would cause the quest counter for College quests to increase due to being marked as a College quest. There are no displayed objectives or journal entries for this quest so it should not have counted toward that total. (Bug #17084) [NR]</li>
<li>Missing in Action (MS09) could end up with the doors to House Gray-Mane becoming locked if the player waits too long to meet with Fralia. This would in turn cause them to flag the player as trespassing. Avulstein's sandbox package inside the home did not have conditions set to stop it once the quest had been officially started. (Bug #17127, Bug #17144) [NR]</li>
<li>Runil has a hello topic that is no longer appropriate to use if Kust is dead. (Bug #17675)</li>

<li>If the player uses the Redwater Skooma during The Bloodstone Chalice (DLC1dunRedwaterDenQST) their followers should only be moved into the cell with them if they have not been told to wait somewhere else. (Bug #17772)</li>
<li>It was possible to set off "Letter From a Friend" (WICastMagic04) events while in the Soul Cairn. (Bug #17642)</li>
<li>Agmaer, Beleval, Ingjard, Durak and Celann will be moved back to Fort Dawnguard prior to Isran's rally scene in Kindred Judgment (DLC1VQ08) because his scene can lock up and get stuck waiting on them to arrive. These particular NPCs can be recruited as followers and left waiting or hired as stewards in Hearthfire homes and end up taking a long time for the AI to move them on its own. (Bug #17858)</li>
<li>The quest priority level on Rescue (DLC1RH06) needed to be raised because some NPCs it can pick are used in other aliases that override the AI that should keep them held as a prisoner. (Bug #17855)</li>
<li>The Dremora merchant needed to be exempt from using the generic trespass dialogue because it blocked his normal dialogue when the player was trespassing. (Bug #16347)</li>

<b>Mesh and Texture Fixes</b>

<p class="h">v2.0.6 (2014-08-02)</p>
<b>USKP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The previous fix for Boethiah's Calling (DA02) to prevent the player from incurring a bounty for the sacrifice needed to be reworked to remove the victim from their crime faction instead. (Bug #16323)</li>
<li>The bugfix to allow Pilgrimage (FreeformRiften13) was never processed in a retro script, which left it possible to end up with no reward if an old save was being played. (Bug #16410)</li>
<li>The fix for Dragon Hunting (FreeformSkyHavenTempleB) had placed the condition check for starting it too soon in the wrong section of the quest. The quest would therefore still start, but it would not be able to advance properly. (Bug #16322)</li>
<li>Oops, unable to give the ring to Ysolda because the added condition was checking if SHE already had it, and not you. (Bug #16898)</li>
<li>Some creature spawners in Bloated Man's Grotto were accidentally included in the predator script fixes even though these don't use the predator script. (Bug #17062)</li>
</ul>

<b>UDBP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Assigning the Tel Mithryn encounter zone to its location had the unintended side effect of blocking several quests from being able to trigger in the area due to the way the encounter zone data affects the location settings on cells. (Bug #16969)</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>FalkreathWatchtowerLocation was incorrectly labeled as being Crossroads Watchtower. (Bug #16366)</li>
<li>Aura Whisper should not trigger guard reactions or word wall letters due to its intent as a silent action. (Bug #16696)</li>
<li>The navmesh in Movarth's Lair needed some further tweaking on the ramp outside the main chamber. Followers were teleporting past it if you went up. (Bug #16405)</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.creationkit.com/Floating_Grass_Fix">&quot;Floating Grass Fix&quot;</a> detailed on the CK Wiki has been added to the USKP ini snippet. Floating landscape was confirmed present in vanilla content and the settings confirmed as not present in the Skyrim.ini file. (Bug #17074)</li>
<li><s>The Twin Souls perk was not applying to Ash Spawns due to the keyword not being added for the perk. (Bug #16819)</s> [USSEP 4.2.7]</li>
<li>The Cyclone shout generates some extraneous sounds when used that can also get stuck once it's finished. (Bug #17108)</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The earlier fix for child eyes having a corrupt normal map setting requires the facegen files to be rebuilt for all of the children in the game. (Bug #16729)</li>
<li>EncGuardSonsM06MaleGuard was incorrectly flagged to not bleed when hit. (Bug #16288)</li>
<li>Naming inconsistencies have been corrected for the following guard actors: GuardIvarsteadImperialBase, GuardShorsStoneImperialBase, GuardHjaalmarchSons, GuardRiftenImperialBase, GuardLoreiusFarmImperial, GuardRiftenImperialKeepPrison01, GuardRiftenSonsKeepPrison01, and GuardSolitudeSonsBase. (Bug #16288)</li>
<li>Gorm's AI pack (MorthalGormEatMoorside18x3) to eat at the inn needed to be shifted to start at 20:00 instead of 18:00 to avoid colliding with his Housecarl package in the longhouse. (Bug #16820)</li>
<li>Skeleton idle sounds can follow the player from where the skeletons are into other interior cells that don't contain skeletons. A workaround, provided by Hexaae, has been implemented to stop this. (Bug #13959)</li>
<li>The guard who patrols at Loreius Farm (GuardLoreiusFarmImperial, GuardLoreiusFarmSons) does not respawn. (Bug #16901) [NR]</li>
<li>Gorm was not in the lock list for Highmoon Hall.</li>
<li>Mirri Severin did not have the dead body cleanup script attached. (Bug #17098) [NR]</li>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The innkeeper's vendor chest in Windhelm does not always stock bread despite Elda saying she sells it consistently. (Bug #16616)</li>
<li>Elk Hide and Deer Hide are both labeled as Deer Hide. The object which the CK refers to as "DeerHide" (DeerHide02 is for actual deer) will now display in game as "Elk Hide". (Bug #16526)</li>
<li>The Blades Cuirass was erroneously set to an armor rating of 44 instead of 34 which would fit with the other pieces in the set. (Bug #16967)</li>
<li>Miraak's Mask had no tempering recipe and thus could not be improved like every other piece of equipment. (Bug #16722)</li>
</ul>

<b>Mesh and Texture Fixes</b>

<li>Several issues fixed for the Winking Skeever mesh: Fixed backface holes, Redid collision, Vanilla collision had no glass material in front of the windows.

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>During Recipe for Disaster (DB08) it was possible to have dialogue end with Anton but not have the script update the quest to unset his essential status and allow you to kill him. (Bug #16809)</li>
<li>In Laid To Rest (MS14), when Hroggar confronts the player to stop them from hurting Alva, he will not turn hostile if the player has previously done favors to raise his relationship status. The dialogue will now explicitly start combat as is intended. (Bug #16767)</li>
<li>Also in MS14, if Alva is still alive when the player goes to Movarth's Lair, she will be hostile to the vampires instead of the player because she is never removed from the friendly factions. (Bug #16766)</li>
<li>Still in MS14, MS14HelgiFinalTopic should not have been available to try and play after killing Movarth since the "Hello" topic Helgi uses already deals with the topic, and it's set to have her be disabled afterward. (Bug #16765)</li>
<li>And lastly, in MS14, the CurrentFollowerFaction property was not filled which could result in some NPCs not being brought to the entrance to Movarth's Lair at the right time.</li>
<li>The scene in Understone Keep (DA11IntroScene) between Brother Verulus and Thongvor Silver-Blood could still result in Verulus standing around indefinitely. The scene startup will only be called now if Thongvor's stage checks do not get used. (Bug #16646)</li>
<li>Queen Freydis Sword is never put on display after finishing Oengul's favor quest (Favor205). (Bug #16619)</li>
<li>It was possible for couriers to deliver letters to find words of power when using the first shout at the Western Watchtower because the event which calls WICastMagic04 did not check to be sure Dragon Rising (MQ104) was far enough along. (Bug #16650)</li>
<li>Irileth and Proventus have a scene discussing the Jarl's safety that should only play once the city is officially at war. (Bug #16617)</li>
<li>It was possible to invest in the Riverwood Trader by talking to Camilla even if Lucan was still alive. (Bug #16847)</li>
<li>Due to dialogue condition errors, it was not possible to invest in The Drunken Huntsman by talking to Elrindir. (Bug #16535)</li>
<li>Temba will take more than 10 bear pelts from you in Grin and Bear It (FreeformIvarstead03) due to an error in the scripting for the end of the quest. (Bug #16720)</li>
<li>Brelyna's Practice (MGRAppBrelyna01) is incorrectly marked as a Miscellaneous quest when it should be marked as a College quest. (Bug #16308)</li>
<li>dunMossMotherQST may end with objective 5 (Locate Valdr's hunting party) stuck in the journal due to the objective not being closed out in enough stages depending on how the player handled the quest. (Bug #16307) [NR]</li>
<li>Telrav's Request (dunNilheimQST) is set up as a Miscellaneous quest but increments the Side Quests achievement when it isn't supposed to. (Bug #16298)</li>
<li>The Savior of Selveni Nethri (dunSouthfringeQST) is set up as a Miscellaneous quest but increments the Side Quests achievement when it isn't supposed to. (Bug #16297)</li>
<li>Accessing your spouse's vendor buy/sell functions while they are also a follower results in getting no gold for the sale and the items disappear. (Bug #16811) (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/16571">BGS Support #16571</a>)</li>
<li>Tavern servers would improperly respond to the player using a cooking pot in an inn when they should only respond to the player sitting down somewhere. (WITavern) (Bug #16725)</li>
<li>A Whiterun marketplace scene between Fralia and Lillith (DialogueWhiterunFraliaLillithScene1) should not play if Eorlund is dead. (Bug #16874)</li>
<li>A Whiterun marketplace scene between Fralia and Ysolda (DialogueWhiterunFraliaYsoldaScene1) should not play if Eorlund is dead. (Bug #16874)</li>
<li>The Penitus Oculatus presence in Dragon Bridge should be disabled if the Stormcloaks have won the civil war and the Emperor has been assassinated. (Bug #16289)</li>
<li>5 Stormcloak attackers and 3 Imperial defenders in the Battle of Solitude were not properly marked with their location reference types, resulting in numerous Papyrus errors being generated at the onset of the siege. (Bug #14644, Bug #14645, Bug #14647)</li>
<li>If enough time has passed since Skjor's death to allow his body to be deleted, Glory of the Dead (C06) will not start. Bethesda mistakenly included a mandatory alias for him despite the fact that he's killed off before the questline gets this far. His alias is now marked as optional to allow the quest to start. (Bug #16958)</li>
<li>The final action phase in scene WERJ06PreQuest needed to be dropped because the dialogue has no recorded audio and can disrupt the scene. (Bug #16961)</li>
<li>The two encounters involving the Carvains (WEDL03 + WEDL04) were flagged with the "run once" option that causes script problems. WEDL03 is supposed to continue popping up until such time as the player kills them, or the DB05 wedding is complete. WEDL04 is only supposed to run one time after the wedding and has been modified to flag them as "killed" once it has finished so they won't show up again. (Bug #16960)</li>
<li>The random encounter with an Afflicted (WEJS14) should not have the "run once" flag selected. (Bug #16959)</li>
<li>Arniel Gane will no longer attempt to return to the College to do a lecture when Under Saarthal (MG02) is running. (Bug #15570)</li>
<li>In Trinity Restored (TG08A) Karliah and Brynjolf do not properly head track each other when they are discussing plans to deal with Mercer.</li>
<li>When training with Vilkas in Call to Arms (C00) he issues combat taunts to the player. This should not happen, so he is being temporarily made a player teammate during the sparring match so that the taunts will be suppressed. (Bug #16643)</li>
<li>The random encounter with corpses, a dragon, and an overturned cart (WEJS18) was generating a copy of the prisoner cart used at Helgen. This ended up being flung a considerable distance from the encounter site due to havok glitches. The quest will now generate a copy of the static version instead so it won't get sent flying when created. (Bug #14956)</li>
<li>When asking Greta about Roggvir, the topics to tell her whether you think he was honorable or a traitor should not come up again once used. (Bug #14837)</li>
<li>Killing Agmaer in Dayspring Canyon before the Dawnguard (DLC1VQ01MiscObjective) quest starts will cause the entire questline to break. (Bug #16812) (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/17271">BGS Support #17271</a>) [NR]</li>
<li>Serana should no longer comment on Skyrim weather while not actually being in Skyrim. (Bug #16527)</li>
<li>Sorine Jurard is not supposed to give out any more quests in Ancient Technology (DLC1RH05) after you've turned in the final Dwemer schematic. (Bug #15167)</li>
<li>Lost Relic (DLC1RH08) should only run 3 times since there are only 3 unique Dawnguard artifacts to be retrieved.</li>
<li>Neloth should be able to deliver a line about the results of the Briarheart experiment when Briarheart Necropsy (DLC2TTR5) is over but the dialogue had bad conditions preventing the player from asking him about it. (Bug #16968)</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>WispActorScript attempts to make wisps start combat even if they are dead. (Bug #16523)</li>
<li>The StopAllSongs function in BardSongsScript did not have the commands to shut down the wedding bard for DB05. (Bug #16072)</li>

<b>Item Fixes</b>

</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The scene quest for innkeepers to show you to your room (WIRentRoomWalkTo) needed to exempt Delphine from using it because she has no recorded dialogue for this event. (Bug #15679)</li>
<li>Sarethi Farm has dialogue indicating the presence of Crimson Nirnroots growing on the farm, but none were ever added to the game. (Bug #15589)</li>
<li>In Revealing The Unseen (MG06) the objective to report to Savos Aren is never completed, and the objective to reach Ancano is never displayed or completed.</li>
<li>Containment (MG05) could possibly fail to start because the aliases for Drevis, Phinis, and Sergius were not marked as optional. One or more could already be locked in a radiant alias somewhere else. They have no essential role in MG05. (Bug #15907)</li>
<li>During The Pursuit (TG07), the trigger enabler for the ramp at Mercer's House needed to be on its own enable marker (which Bethesda conveniently supplied) in order to avoid being disabled when Vald's triggers get turned off after freeing him from his debt. (Bug #16047)</li>
<li>DialogueSolitudeLisett02Topic should not be available for use if Corpulus is dead. (Bug #16114)</li>
<li>DialogueSolitudeSorex02Topic01Continue had a response that should have been used if Corpulus is dead, but neither response had the proper conditions to check for that. (Bug #16115)</li>
<li>Follower dialogue responses for dogs did not all have an audible sound attached. (Bug #16100)</li>
<li>The innkeeper escort quest (WIRentRoomWalkTo) had a priority conflict with the BardSongs quest, so any innkeeper who was also a bard would fail to run the escort scene to take the player to their room. (Bug #16224, Bug #16221)</li>
<li>Two greeting lines in DialogueKynesgrove were inappropriate to deliver if Iddra is dead. (Bug #16223)</li>
<li>Ysolda had a greeting line that is not appropriate to deliver if Hulda is dead. (Bug #16222)</li>
<li>Bolund had a greeting line that is not appropriate to deliver if Valga Vinicia is dead. (Bug #16220)</li>
<li>Narri had a greeting line that is not appropriate to deliver if Valga Vinicia is dead. (Bug #16219)</li>
<li>WIAssault02 did not filter out children as targets to be assaulted. (Bug #16217)</li>
<li>If Keerava is dead, Sealing the Deal (FreeformRiften06) should not be available to start. Also if Keerava is killed after accepting the quest, it should be failed just as it would if Talen-Jei is killed. (Bug #16216)</li>
<li>Skjor had two additional greeting lines that were unable to be used because the condition checks for them were incorrect.</li>
<li>When the explosion at the end of Revealing the Unseen (MG06) occurs, followers would be teleported into the room even if you had told them to wait elsewhere. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Containment#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>In Brelyna's Practice (MGRAppBrelyna01) it was possible for her spell to miss the player if they were in 3rd person or if line of sight was blocked by an obstruction. A failsafe has been added to add the spell to the player should this happen. (Bug #15693)</li>
<li>Sanuarach Mine (FreeformKarthwastenA) never adds Karthwasten back to the Civil War if the player "resolves" the scenario by killing both sides.</li>
<li>If Angi is killed, her archery quest (dunArcherQST) has no reason to keep running.</li>
<li>During A Night To Remember (DA14) Ysolda could present the dialogue to accept the ring even if the player did not have it. (Bug #16098)</li>
<li>The Aspiring Mage encounter (WE31) should now be working entirely as expected with the mage wielding the staff. The CK's warning about unresolvable alias dependencies turned out to be bogus, and his AI package should have been a use item type instead of a travel type. They even had a custom combat style for him that wasn't linked to the package. Plus the Papyrus errors associated with the script have been fixed as well. The encounter will also properly recycle itself until the player has resolved it. (Bug #12053, Bug #14692)</li>
<li>Ulfric has an alias in Blood on the Ice (MS11) which can delay Brunwulf becoming Jarl if the quest is still running when the Battle of Windhelm ends. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Brunwulf_Free-Winter#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>If the guard who fills the roll of Crime Scene Investigator for MS11 is killed, the quest will stall permanently if the player is unable to break into Hjerim to jump stages, or if the guard was at the second crime scene. The CSI alias will now be marked essential so this guard cannot be killed and break the quest.</li>
<li>Elda Early-Dawn would still warn the player not to get fresh with Susanna even after she was killed in Blood on the Ice (MS11). (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Elda_Early-Dawn#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>An infinite speech exploit was fixed in Buy Dwarven Artifact (WIAddItem07) when persuading Calcelmo to pay more money. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Calcelmo#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>During Diplomatic Immunity (MQ201) the two generic carriage drivers are supposed to share the same two dialogue lines. This was not possible because the conditions were only set to the first one instead of both of them. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Carriage_Driver#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>Cicero has a line he uses when the player shouts near him that should only be used once you've been designated as the Listener. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Cicero#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>When using your Thane's influence to stop an arrest, if you back out of the dialogue before the guard finishes, it may not register the bounty as paid. The next encounter with a guard that results in you being arrested will not have the Thane option available. The script commands on all 18 possible topics have been moved to the "Begin" block rather than the "End" block which will ensure they run as soon as the guard starts speaking. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Crime#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>It is potentially possible for the Staff of Magnus to duplicate during The Staff of Magnus (MG07) because a separate helper quest runs an EquipItem call on the base object instead of the alias reference in MG07. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Staff_of_Magnus#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>A Few Words with You (Favor013) will no longer allow dead targets to be chosen. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:A_Few_Words_with_You#Bugs">UESP</a>) [NR]</li>
<li>The stage 15 journal entry for The Forsworn Conspiracy (MS01) mentions the murder in the marketplace even if you killed Weylin before he could attack Margret. The journal will now refer to it as an "incident" instead. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Forsworn_Conspiracy#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>It is no longer possible to exploit dialogue timing to get free houses and decorations for them. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Glitches#Free_House">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>When becoming a werewolf, the game cures you of vampirism. The script responsible for this left out removing the Sanguinare Vampiris disease that leads up to vampirism. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Glitches#Vampiric_Werewolves">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>The purchased horse reference at Katla's Farm outside Solitude was erroneously pointing to the horse at the Riften Stables. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Horses#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>If Knifepoint Ridge is visited for the first time during Boethiah's Calling (DA02), the location is not marked cleared when the Champion is killed.

<li>Lisbet's Missing Shipment (FreeformMarkarthE) is never stopped when completed. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Lisbet%27s_Missing_Shipment#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>The Mistwatch quest (dunMistwatchQST) attempts to set an incorrect stage if the player kills Christer, which makes it impossible to tell Fjola you've "gotten rid of him". (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mistwatch_%28quest%29#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>dunMistwatchQST does not take into account that the player may kill Fjola after getting the wedding band. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mistwatch_%28quest%29#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>In Mourning Never Comes (DB03), it was possible to taunt Nilsine Shatter-Shield before Muiri had even told you she was a bonus target. This was due to a bad stage check condition. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mourning_Never_Comes#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>The mini-quest at Soljund's Sinkhole (FreeformSoljundsSinkholeA, DialogueSoljundsSinkhole) was supposed to provide the player a choice as to whether they would take the quest or not but the dialogue linkages were all wrong and the script commands to start the quest were all in the wrong responses. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Perth#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>During Pilgrimage (FreeformRiften13) it was possible to put Alessandra's dagger into a weapon case and then still turn in the quest to brng it to Andurs because the dialogue did not verify the player was still carrying it. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Pilgrimage#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>In Stabilized (FreeformRiften22), telling Shadr you won't help him still pays you the reward and counts toward the Thane quest even though it should not. A script variable that should have been updated wasn't.</li>
<li>FavorJarlsMakeFriendsTrackEvent did not have the second NPC alias set to allow reserved, so if it received a second one who was in a reserved alias elsewhere that NPC would not be counted for favor tracking in the hold they're part of. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Thane_of_Haafingar#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>If the player succeeded in persuading the bandit at Valtheim Towers to accept 50 gold instead of 200, the 50 gold is never added to the bandit's inventory.</li>
<li>It was possible to exploit a potentially infinite number of gold rewards from Quintus when the damaged Phial has been returned. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_White_Phial_%28quest%29#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>The Shearpoint map marker will no longer be immediately available for fast travel if it is revealed by guards but you've never been there before. (Bug #16138) [NR]</li>
<li>Svari's setup dialogue leading into recovering Roggvir's amulet (SolitudeFreeform03) was badly arranged. (Bug #15143)</li>
<li>Petra's alias in The Affairs of Hagravens (dunBlindCliffQST) does not always have her name properly assigned to the hagraven who fills the role. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Blind_Cliff_Cave#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>Climb the Steps (FreeformIvarstead04) never removes the supplies from the chest when the quest ends. The object is a static container and when dropped, will hover in place permanently. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Climb_the_Steps#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>Oengul War-Anvil's quest to retrieve Queen Freydis's sword (Favor205) results in him offering it for sale once the quest is over. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Oengul_War-Anvil#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>No One Escapes Cidhna Mine (MS02) has been added to the list of quest exemptions for vampire attacks in Markarth.</li>
<li>If a vampire attack on a city is being shut down due to an interfering quest, the attackers will be immediately disabled instead of waiting for the DeleteWhenAble code to clean them up.</li>
<li>In Rings of Blood Magic (DLC1RV08) it was possible for the game to pick an essential target. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Rings_of_Blood_Magic#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>Speaking to the Jarl of Falkreath and then reading the courier's letter will cause the "Speak to the Jarl of Falkreath" objective to become permanently stuck in the journal. (Bug #16406) [NR]</li>
<li>Elynea Mothren has a goodbye line for use in Reluctant Steward (DLC2TT1) which could not be played because it was checking for the wrong quest. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Dragonborn:Elynea_Mothren#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>

</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>CWScript - The GetMyEditorLocationHoldLocation() function and the DetermineAndSetCrimeFactionForSoldierActor() function were both charged with determining the location of various soldiers in a garrison. This was done using GetEditorLocation on each alias, up to 64 soldiers in each possible battle. This resulted in thousands of lines of Papyrus script errors because GetEditorLocation apparently returns a NONE sometimes instead of the expected CK editor location for the actor it's looking at. These errors meant that processing of a garrison reset called for in several minor villages and at every single fort in the game would be incomplete because of aborted function calls. This has now been corrected by changing the two calls for GetEditorFunction into calls for GetCurrentLocation. This should be adequate for the purpose since soldiers at each fort and the various minor villages should remain within the affected locations when the resets are called for. (Bug #13860)</li>
<li>QF_dunStonehillBarrowQST_000CF915 had more instances of activation refs being activated by NONE. (Bug #15761)</li>
<li>QF_DialogueMarkarthIntroWorld_000AF75F had no sanity check to prevent starting combat with Weylin if he was dead. (Bug #15672)</li>
<li>doorBar should disable the linked navcut box if the bar is disabled. This prevents NPC pathing problems from unmaintained cutters.</li>
<li>QF_SolitudeFreeform06_000D69FB was trying to directly add a global variable to the player rather than using it to add a small amount of gold for the quest reward. (Bug #15598)</li>
<li>QF_dunPOIReachShrineTheftQST_0003AA66 lacked sanity checks for dead or disabled actors. (Bug #15590)</li>
<li>defaultSetStageTrigSCRIPT should bail out of processing commands to set a quest stage if it is not able to start the quest it belongs to. Testing has shown that this is due to the quest having been run once before and then being stopped. The debug trap message has been removed now. (Bug #15680)</li>
<li>defaultSetStageOnPlayerAcquireItem and defaultSetStageOnPlayerAcquire will perform a sanity check to make sure they only set stages on quests that are running AND have a prereq property other than -1. (Bug #15331, Bug #15781, Bug #14321, Bug #14002)</li>

<li>Calixto's death item setting to provide the key to his house was not correctly set. (Bug #15031)</li>

<li>The river along the road on the south side of Whiterun did not have proper navmesh markings to tell the AI that it was water. (Bug #15223)</li>
<li>Pelagia Farm, Chillfurrow Farm, and Battle-Born Farm all needed to have their parent locations set to WhiterunLocation instead of WhiterunHoldLocation. (Bug #15224)</li>

<li>AngasMillCommonHouseLocation, BrandyMugFarmInteriorLocation, DawnstarSilussHouseLocation, HlaaluFarmInteriorLocation, KarthwastenEnmonsHouseLocation, LoreiusFarmhouseLocation, MarkarthStablesLocation, and RiftenBeggarsRowLocation needed LocationCenterMarker objects inside to complete their basic setup.</li>
<li>Packages DBCiceroStateFollowPackage, DBInitiate1StateFollowPackage, and DBInitiate2StateFollowPackage needed to have their package flags adjusted to bring them into conformity with the equivalent packages for the normal player follower slot. (Bug #15171)</li>
<li>Swindler's Den could not get marked as cleared because the normal boss bandit occupying it was not marked as a Boss. (Bug #15250)</li>
<li>Followers could not navigate the exit in Shalidor's Maze because the navmesh did not connect to the exit. (Bug #15092)</li>
<li>In the process of fixing the above, it was discovered that the center portion of the zone had 18 navmeshes, 9 of which were duplicated and overlapping on top of each other. Broken border connections and mislabeled water triangles effectively made the entire maze area impassible by NPCs.</li>
<li>The jumpdown connector in Sunderstone Gorge was corrupt and required rebuilding. (Bug #15036)</li>
<li>WinterholdCollegeLocation should be a part of WinterholdLocation rather than WinterholdHoldLocation due to a number of scene dependencies expecting this to be the case. (Bug #15162)</li>
<li>WhiterunJarlSandboxQuartersDefault has been changed to explicitly sandbox in the Jarl's Quarters for Whiterun so that Vignar Gray-Mane won't end up sandboxing at Jorrvaskr instead. (Bug #14666)</li>
<li>Despite being part of The Reach and having large sections exposed to the sky above, Karthspire Redoubt (the part of Sky Haven Temple where the puzzle doors are) only ever uses fog weather which doesn't match the parent worldspace. (Bug #14491)</li>
<li>DragonRendHitFXExplosion, ExplosionShockStorm01, ExplosionShockBoltExpert01, and ExplosionFireBoltExpert01 all have the distant explosion sounds set but do not have the corresponding close-up sounds set. (Bug #13419)</li>
<li>FSTDirtJumpUpImpact, FSTGrassJumpUpImpact, FSTStoneSolidJumpUpImpact, FSTWoodJumpUpImpact, FSTSnowJumpUpImpact, and FSTGravelJumpUpImpact had no corresponding impact sound data for the player in 3rd person mode which would cause the sounds to originate from the camera center point rather than from the left speaker which normally handles the sound sourcing. (Bug #12818)</li>
<li>WIRentRoomWalkToInnkeeperPackage has too large a radius and sometimes leads to innkeepers finishing the escort because the marker is too close behind a wall. (Bug #15197)</li>
<li>The navmesh pathing in Windhelm between the docks and the city gates lacks preferred pathing which causes NPCs to take the long way and swim to reach the docks. (Bug #15332, Bug #15334)</li>
<li>NPCs were attempting to path through too small a triangle outside the New Gnisis Corner Club. This triangle has been eliminated and the remaining ones fixed up to be of more appropriate size. (Bug #15333)</li>
<li>Minor corrections to preferred pathing and unmarked water triangles in the navmeshes for Riverwood.</li>
<li>Corrections to the navmesh in Shriekwind Bastion so followers won't get tripped up trying to navigate.</li>
<li>EnchBoundBattleaxeFX, EnchBoundBowFX, and EnchBoundSwordFX will be marked hidden in the UI so the effect they temporarily place on the player when hit won't show up in the effects list (or on SkyUI's HUD). (Bug #15080)</li>
<li>Several holes in the navmesh outside Riften's north gate have been fixed. These were caused by incorrectly configured content for the cut Civil War battle here.</li>
<li><s>Magelight was not benefiting from the Stability perk like other alteration spells. (Bug #13450)</s> [USSEP 4.0.8]</li>
<li>The Gift of Charity will now properly stack with Glibness potions. (Bug #13379)</li>
<li>The Clear Skies shout will no longer deliver an unintentional stagger effect to all NPCs in the area of the shockwave. VoiceClearSkiesEffect1, VoiceClearSkiesEffect2, and VoiceClearSkiesEffect3 have all been set to archtype script instead of stagger. (Bug #430)</li>
<li>Several navmesh triangles were too high off the ground on the road behind the inn in Dragon Bridge.</li>
<li>Several navmesh triangles in Whiterun situated over water were not marked as water.</li>
<li>Delphine appears to have been unable to light all of the torch pits in Sky Haven Temple due to bad navmeshing in the cell making her unable to reach them all reliably. (Bug #13441)</li>
<li>Ravage Magicka and Ravage Stamina potions did not work correctly due to the recover flag not being enabled on the magic effects AlchDamageMagickaRavage and AlchDamageStaminaRavage. (Bug #15463, Bug #14630)</li>
<li>The following encounter zones did not have their locations set, leading to inconsistent leveled list usage: DushnikhYalZone, FortDunstadZone, FortGreymoorZone, FortNeugradZone, GloomboundMineZone, RiftenRatwayZone, RiverwoodZone, VolskyggeZone</li>
<li>The stairway from the Windhelm dock gates down to the actual dock area was not flagged as being part of WindhelmLocation. (Bug #15505)</li>
<li>Call to Arms did not work properly with the Master of the Mind perk. (Bug #15488)</li>
<li>The AlchDamageMagickaRate was misconfigured to use the base regen rate instead of the proper multiplier rate for applying the penalty. (Bug #15549)</li>
<li><s>The following AI packs needed to have "Allow Idle Chatter", "Hellos to Player", and "Random Conversations" disabled because they currently allow NPCs to talk while asleep: DefaultSleepAnytimeNoLockNoWarn, DefaultSleepEditorLoc0x7, DefaultSleepEditorLoc12x4, DefaultSleepEditorLoc12x8, DefaultSleepEditorLoc17x5, DefaultSleepEditorLoc1x8, DefaultSleepEditorLoc20x8, DefaultSleepEditorLoc22x10, DefaultSleepEditorLoc22x6, DefaultSleepEditorLoc22x7, DefaultSleepEditorLoc24x8, DefaultSleepEditorLoc2x4, DefaultSleepEditorLoc2x8, DefaultSleepEditorLoc8x8, DefaultSleepEditorLocNoLock24x8, DefaultSleepEditorLocNoLock2x4, DefaultSleepEditorLocNOLOCKING24x8, and DefaultSleepPackageAnyTime.

<li>Several lines of dialogue in Darkwater Crossing refer to an unknown NPC named "Meieran". Given the descriptions of this NPC as an "adventurous elf", Derkeethus is likely what this NPC was turned into. Audio files have been spliced to make the change.

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The Battle for Solitude can break if the player has never visited the city prior to the fight. A fail-safe trigger has been added to enable the proper gates and deal with shutting down Roggvir's execution. (Bug #15277)</li>
<li>When a Civil War siege battle starts, the player is able to disrupt the scene by talking to various soldiers, including the general leading the attack. All 3 scenes in CWSiege have been marked to prevent player activation of all participating aliases. (Bug #12145)</li>
<li>Taarie was still issuing comments about the player going to the Blue Palace after they had already gone and performed the task she asked for. (Bug #15172)</li>
<li>Freir should not offer the topic option to ask about the White Gold Concordat until she's mentioned it in another dialogue branch. (Bug #15142)</li>
<li>Using Thieves Guild influence to bribe your way out of an arrest was comparing the gold cost to the wrong variable and thus not reflecting the proper discounted price it should be. (Bug #15089)</li>
<li>The final hello response in DarkBrotherhoodSanctuaryDialogue contained an erroneous check for the player being female. (Bug #15050)</li>
<li>Arondil's corpse never cleans up because dunYngvildQST is never terminated. (Bug #14991)</li>
<li>The scene with Frodnar, Dorthe, and Stump (DialogueRiverwoodKidsScene) should not play if Stump is dead. (Bug #15059)</li>
<li>If a spouse is killed, it was intended that the player be allowed to remarry but the command to restart RelationshipMarriage was never added to RelationshipMarriageFIN. (Bug #14856)</li>
<li>Hunt and Gather (FreeformRiften14) would not be properly initiated by Wylandriah if the player had picked up any of the items prior to her giving the quest. (Bug #14768)</li>
<li>If Lynly Star-Sung is intimidated during The Lover's Requital (FreeformRiften02) she does not appropriately harbor bitterness toward the player due to the relationship values not being adjusted. (Bug #14754)</li>
<li>The speech check in The Lover's Requital (FreeformRiften02) is incorrectly checking Lynly's speech skill instead of the player's. (Bug #14884)</li>
<li>The Penitus Oculatus are not removed from Dragon Bridge if the player destroys the Dark Brotherhood and the Stormcloaks take control in Solitude. (Bug #14674)</li>
<li>All dialogue used when the player collides with an NPC will be blocked if that NPC is currently in combat with the player. (Bug #12845)</li>

<li>Hulda still tells the player the Companions are recruiting even after they've joined. (Bug #15221)</li>

<li>When aborting dialogue with the wilderness thief encounter (WERJ02) the thief will use a generic goodbye due to the dialogue option not having the goodbye flag set. (Bug #15210)</li>
<li>Dervenin's initial dialogue branch for The Mind of Madness (DA15) incorrectly checks stage conditions for The Black Star (DA01). (Bug #15144)</li>
<li>After accepting Dervenin's quest (DA15) the dialogue does not loop back to the proper branch. (Bug #15144)</li>
<li>Lodi does not start playing his flute as expected during Bound Until Death (DB05) because his 3D doesn't enable fast enough for the bard song scripts to catch up. (Bug #15112)</li>
<li>Also in DB05, the two wedding guests coming in from outside the city need to be manually checked to make sure they're not dead and then moved into the city. Their AI will not get them to Solitude in time if the player heads there shortly after getting the quest. (Bug #15112)</li>
<li>One more issue for DB05 - Erikur and Bryling are set to non-essential status once this quest is done but they both have other quests they're involved in. If Erikur is dead but The Dainty Sload (TGTQ02) is not finished yet, the entire Thieves Guild quest line will halt. He will be resurrected if this has happened. If Bryling dies before Payment Delivery (FreeformStonehillsA) that quest will be marked as failed in the journal and shut down. (Bug #14727)</li>
<li>Urag's Note for Fetch me that Book! (MGR20B) does not display the name of the book or the location to find it in. This is due to the alias missing the flags to store text. (Bug #15075)</li>
<li>The follower alias in The Fallen (MQ301) should be filled manually when needed at Dragonsreach since the player can ditch their follower at any time between when the quest starts and they arrive there. (Bug #15056)</li>
<li>Delayed Burial (DB01Misc) is not terminated if either stage 210 or 215 is called. (Bug #15054)</li>
<li>Aventus Aretino had not been properly configured to move out if the quest came up after the USKP was installed. (Bug #15052)</li>
<li>Brina Merilis has 3 topics that no longer make any sense if she is exiled to Solitude during the civil war. (Bug #15048)</li>
<li>Froki's dialogue topics to direction to the second and third tiers of Kyne's Sacred Trials (dunHunterQST) do not link to the correct part of the topic chain, resulting in incorrect responses. (Bug #14948)</li>
<li>Completing The Forgemaster's Fingers (FavorOrcsIntro) would cause the blood-kin topic in A Friend to the Orcs (RelationshipOrcs) to become active even though that should not happen and makes no logical sense. (Bug #14821)</li>
<li>Irileth and Balgruuf have some topics that are no longer fitting to be used while in exile in Solitude. (Bug #14778)</li>
<li>Nenya has two topics which are no longer relevant after being exiled to Solitude. (Bug #14777)</li>
<li>Odar has a hello topic which is no longer appropriate to use after General Tullius is dead. (Bug #14776)</li>
<li>Velehk Sain's body does not clean up after killing him in Forgotten Names (dunMidden01QST) because his death never shuts down the quest. (Bug #14728)</li>
<li>Harrald should not offer the quest to retrieve his sword from Balimund (FreeformRiften16) if he has been exiled to Windhelm. (Bug #14706)</li>
<li>Harrald has two dialogue topics that are not appropriate for use after he's been exiled to Windhelm. (Bug #14706)</li>
<li>Saerlund has two dialogue topics that are not appropriate for use after he's been exiled to Windhelm. (Bug #14706)</li>
<li>In Blood on the Ice (MS11) children were not removed from the valid list of 3rd victims. (Bug #15071)</li>
<li>If the player broke in to Hjerim after Blood on the Ice (MS11) was officially started, but no journal entries had been made yet, the quest would update an objective but there would be no explanation for what's going on.</li>
<li>Similarly, if the player breaks in to Hjerim BEFORE MS11 is officially started, picks up either a flier or the amulet, the quest will initiate but there will be no journal entry made to explain the quest.</li>
<li>Arivanya should remain essential until it is time to either have her be the second MS11 victim, or the final MS11 victim. Otherwise she could be killed prior to this and end up duplicating when the time comes. [NR]</li>
<li>When discussing evidence with Wuunferth in MS11, you can tell him Calixto was wrong about the amulet even if you'd never discussed it with Calixto.</li>
<li>If the shortcuts are taken to complete MS11 (picking the lock, stealing the key, etc) the blood trail and first victim's body will be properly removed from the game.</li>
<li>If either of the alternate bodies for MS11 had to be generated, the references need to be deleted when appropriate as they were created by a PlaceAtMe call. [NR]</li>
<li>dunWhiteRiverWatch_Boss on dunMasterQST needed to be marked as optional because the game wants to clear it if dunWhiteRiverWatchQST has been completed. (Bug #14963) [NR]</li>
<li>A second trigger ahead of the first one for MS13BleakFallsBarrowLeverScene needed to be placed because the scene would often not start properly. (Bug #13874)</li>
<li>If Thongvor Silver-Blood is exiled and the player enters Understone Keep for the first time, Brother Verulus will not be standing around waiting for him in order to run the scene about the Hall of the Dead being closed. (Bug #12613)</li>
<li>DialogueWinterholdCollegeOnmundNordsFollowUp1 had an incorrectly applied "invisible continue" tag added to its only response which caused the conversation to jump to a response for another question. (Bug #12424)</li>
<li>Erandur's 11 general idle comments were all erroneously set to run in caves (and also never in the Tamriel worldspace) so they could not be used, often resulting in him repeating the same generic line over and over. (Bug #14102)</li>
<li>The 3 generic dialogue responses for JobMisc vendors will no longer be available to fences because the dialogue lines are not recorded for some of their voices. (Bug #13519)</li>
<li>The escort quest where an innkeeper shows you to your room does not work reliably due to the quest missing the keyword event check. (Bug #15197)</li>
<li>Jora's topic discussing various devout Windhelm citizens is only sensible if spoken while in the temple. (Bug #15280)</li>
<li>In The Pursuit (TG07), when Brynjolf goes to open the vault door, it may already be open. This was likely because the door wasn't owned by him and so could be pushed open by any NPC who wandered too close. (Bug #11923) [NR]</li>
<li>TG01BersiQuestBranchTopic01 has a grossly incorrect subtitle for the recorded audio. (Bug #15354)</li>
<li>Riverwood's Stormcloaks are not reliably activated when the Battle of Whiterun is completed in favor of the Stormcloaks. (Bug #13771)</li>
<li>Jon Battle-Born should no longer suggest joining the Companions once the player has done so. (Bug #15361)</li>
<li>Falion and the Jarl do not properly headtrack each other during the confrontation scene in Falion's Secret (FreeformMorthalA)</li>
<li>During A Night To Remember (DA14) if the player convinces Ysolda to tell them where the wedding is, going to Witchmist Grove to get the ring results in the quest objective to return it becoming totally stuck. The Hagraven should be disabled at this point as she is not intended to be available when Morvunskar has been revealed. (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/16583">BGS Support #16583</a>) (Bug #14253)</li>
<li>Torbjorn has a hello topic tha references an NPC cut from the game. (Bug #15372)</li>
<li>The idle topics for Tending the Flames (MS05KingOlafsFestival) needed to be set to use the alias references just like the Hello topics are. (Bug #15402)</li>
<li>Several dialogue lines in Riften do not play due to bad condition checks and failures to update script pointers. Keerava's rumor topics have also been fixed to be on the 24 hour cycle just like other innkeepers. (Bug #15396)</li>
<li>If the player runs away during Wizard Duel (WIChangeLocation03) the objective to kill the wizard is never cleared. (Bug #15401) [NR]</li>
<li>Some dialogue lines for guards near Half Moon Mill needed conditions to make sure Hert was still alive.</li>
<li>If Maramal's scene about Mara, dragons, and debauchery (DialogueRiftenSS05) has not yet run, he will delay forcegreeting the player until it has. (Bug #15387)</li>
<li>Several of the scenes in Take Up Arms (C00) do not have proper head tracking for the participants.</li>
<li>Farkas would repeat his work intro line after offering the first work quest because it wasn't checking to see if he already had before trying again. (Bug #14926)</li>
<li>The unmarked quest in Yngol's Barrow (dunYngolBarrowQST) will now reserve the location so that Dungeon Delving (Favor158) will not run alongside it. Letting both quests run in the same location at the same time makes one or the other impossible to complete. (Bug #15105)</li>
<li>When King Olaf's Festival ended its script, the shutdown stage was not stopping the bard song routines which resulted in Ataf and Jorn getting stuck outside playing flutes when they're not supposed to be there. (Bug #8467)</li>

<li>After freeing Vald of his debt in The Pursuit (TG07) it is possible for him to turn hostile to the player anyway because the trigger boxes used to determine that are not disabled once he says he's leaving the city. The sizes of these trigger boxes have also been adjusted so that they can't be accidentally set off from the wrong side of the gate at ground level. (Bug #14192)</li>
<li>Killing Helvard undetected during DBSideContract11 should no longer result in the Jarl's relationship rank with the player dropping because of it. This usually led to not being able to buy Lakeview Manor in the Hearthfire DLC. (Bug #5186)</li>
<li>If Revyn Sadri dies, Aval Atheron is supposed to take over as the new shopkeeper there. Aval has his own market stall already and therefore cannot actually take over the post. Idesa Sadri has been selected to fill the role as backup for the pawn shop instead. (Bug #13126)</li>
<li>Brunwulf Free-Winter should be designated as "Jarl Brunwulf Free-Winter" once CWFinale has completed. He will no longer offer the Favor104 quest which usually blocks this change from taking place. If Favor104 is already started it will be left running to allow the player to complete it properly.

<li>The Affairs of Hagravens (dunBlindCliffQST) counts toward the Sideways achievement when it isn't supposed to.</li>
<li>Scenes when first entering Ustengrav where the necromancers are supposed to be tending bandit thralls would be disrupted because the trigger to start the quest which holds the aliases that should pacify them is inside the dungeon and does not generally have time to run its script before the AI decides to attack each other. The trigger box has now been moved to the outside of the dungeon so that the quest will be started and the pacification aliases will be properly filled before the player gets inside.

<li>If asked to wait somewhere, Dark Brotherhood followers never time out and return to the Dawnstar Sanctuary.

<li>Attempting to speak to Kesh while he is making the fume in The Only Cure (DA13) results in halting the quest. His alchemy scene required a block activation checkbox to be enabled in order to prevent this. (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/16549/">BGS Support #16549</a>)</li>
<li>At the end of The Wolf Queen Awakened (MS06) if you back out of dialogue before Styr has said his last line, the quest never closes out. A WalkAway topic link to his last line has been added so that even if you tab out, it will still run properly to end the quest.

<li>Volkihar vampire bodies do not clean up after completing Kindred Judgment (DLC1VQ08) because one of the dialogue quests (DLC1DialogueVampireCuredBlock) has the NPCs locked into aliases. (Bug #15169)</li>
<li>It was possible for Sinding to play static instead of proper dialogue due to errors in the setup for DLC1DialogueWerewolfBlock. (Bug #12042)</li>
<li>All dialogue interactions with the hireable dogs (death hounds + huskies) have been assigned the DLC general dog sounds so that they are no longer just silent text. (Bug #12019)</li>
<li>Rescue (DLC1RH06) will no longer choose Driftshade Sanctuary or Gallows Rock for possible dungeon locations. (Bug #15623)</li>
<li>The 6 "eclipse attacks" (DLC1EclipseAttack1, DLC1EclipseAttack2, DLC1EclipseAttack3, DLC1EclipseAttack4, DLC1EclipseAttack5, DLC1EclipseAttack6) could disrupt or completely ruin the following quests: Blood on the Ice (MS11), Innocence Lost (DB01), Forsworn Conspiracy (MS01), Roggvir's execution (SolitudeOpening). (Bug #15330, Bug #15321)</li>
<li>In Experimental Subject (DLC2TTR4a), Neloth could be asked if he needed help with a project but then never explain what it is due to the condition checks on the dialogue chain being on the wrong response.</li>

<li>On a sunny day, the shadows cast by the large arches in Solitude had obvious holes in them. This was caused by the base city mesh above the rocks having gaping holes in it, and the city mesh itself not casting proper shadows on all of its sections. A new shadow plane mesh has been created to plug up the remaining holes and produce a properly cast shadow on the ground below the arch. There is no performance hit from this solution.

<li>Sailor's Repose (dunFrostflowAbyssBoonEffect) had an incorrect taper duration set, in addition to also having an incorrect magnitude set. Its abilities are applied by perk and the effect entries are merely to make it show up in the UI when the player receives it. (Bug #14878)</li>
<li>Erikur's house in Solitude should not have been made a valid target for Thieves Guild jobs. It's marked with a "protected" shadowmark and the theft markers inside are not setup up correctly. (Bug #14905, Bug #14904, Bug #14903, Bug #14638, Bug #14158)</li>

<li>During the Civil War battles in Whiterun, Solitude, or Windhelm, it is possible for adopted children currently living in those cities to be transported back to their editor locations due to the AI package CWCitizensFleeSandboxEditorLocationLockDoors. This package will now have a condition blocking it from taking effect on members of the BYOHRelationshipAdoptionFaction so the kids will instead flee to the player's house under the control of the proper quest for this purpose. (Bug #13002)</li>
<li>The North Wind power (DLC2StandingStoneWindSpell) was assigned the wrong effect entry which resulted in it displaying the wrong UI data. (Bug #15013)</li>
<li>Nordic and Stalhrim axes will now be properly adjusted in the Limbsplitter and Hack & Slash perks. (Bug #13120)</li>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Durnehviir was assigned the wrong dragon script which led to errors due to not having any of the death properties set. He has now been given the special UDGP version of this script which was devised for his summoned copy. (Bug #14720)</li>
<li>Durnehviir also had a problem with his wings showing too many holes when he manages to transition to LOD distance. His LOD skin has now been changed to use the same one as his up close skin. The holes should no longer be a major issue. Note that he is intended to have holes, he's an undead decaying dragon. (Bug #12609)</li>
<li>Due to template inheritence issues, Krosulhah was not properly being portrayed as a serpentine dragon as he should have been. He also lacked the appropriate properties to allow for dragon heart scale harvesting. (Bug #15062)</li>
<li>Ash Hoppers that can ambush you from underground did not play an ambush sound upon digging out. A new sound marker has been created and added to the sound property on the DLC2EncAshHopperAmbush record. (Bug #14950)</li>
</ul>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The blood fountain in the Volkihar Cathedral does not make any sound of flowing blood (water basically). A sound marker for AMBWaterDrain01SmallRadiusLP has been added to resolve this. (Bug #13788)</li>
<li>Bralsa Drel incorrectly refers to Neloth as a "her" in both the audio and subtitle text. (sound\Voice\Dragonborn.esm\DLC2FemaleDarkElfCommoner\DLC2TT1_DLC2TT1SkoomaYes_00019595_1.fuz) (Bug #15002)</li>

<li>Arniel's Endeavor (MGRArniel03) never removes objective 40 from the journal when completed. (Bug #14959)</li>
<li>Driftshade Sanctuary and Gallows Rock should both be excluded from Preemptive Strike (DLC1RH03) because Silver Hand bandits will kill the targets before the player can reach them. (Bug #15061)</li>
<li>Several instances of a broken dialogue conditioning script have been replaced which should allow Serana's "mental model" to update properly as the player talks to her throughout the game. It's quite possible that this may result in significant differences in Serana's intended reactions since the broken scripts left part of her character development untouched. (Bug #14966) [NR]</li>
<li>In Deceiving the Herd (DLC1RV03), a high profile target who also happens to be in an alias they are swapped out of when killed does not actually register as being high profile. A formlist has been added to detect these cases and is attached to the DLCRadiant quest which performs the actual check. (Bug #14812)</li>
<li>When a hireling is made steward, they will no longer have steward dialogue options blocked after accepting their position. (Bug #15114)</li>
<li>It was not possible to ask a hireling to become your steward after bringing them to the property due to an erroneous condition that was blocking the PotentialHireling faction. (Bug #15116)</li>
<li>After completing Unearthed (DLC2dunKolbjornQST), the excavation site is supposed to clear up once you're far enough away. The script controling this was incorrectly polling the alias on Ralis when it should have been polling a static object at the site. This resulted in the possibility that the registered update would fail to be renewed, leaving the quest open forever. (Bug #14987)</li>
<li>Neloth's random hello if you agreed to be his test subject for the silence spell would still play even if you had told him you weren't interested. (Bug #15022)</li>
<li>Completing A New Debt (DLC2TT1b) by paying the money or killing Mogrul does not stop his thugs from chasing you down because DLC2WE11 is not terminated if it's running. (Bug #15020)</li>
<li>If all 5 Black Book quests are completed (DLC2BlackBook03Quest, DLC2BlackBook04Quest, DLC2BlackBook05Quest, DLC2BlackBook06Quest, DLC2BlackBook07Quest), the Madman encounter (DLC2WE06) will be prevented from starting in the Story Manager since the 6th one is in a location DLC2WE06 cannot send you to. (Bug #15019)</li>
<li>The objective to collect 10 Scathecraw for the Rieklings at Thirsk does not clear when you bring it back and instead was waiting until you agreed to help attack the Nords.</li>
<li>Bralsa Drel has a line in Reluctant Steward (DLC2TT1) meant to be said if the player is carrying skooma but it could not play due to bad conditions.</li>
<li>During Served Cold (DLC2RR02) if you confront Tilisu Severin in the open the objective to set her as being recognized will not be set even though it should have been.</li>
<li>Aeta is adoptable via the Hearthfire DLC if her parents are killed but she will have dialogue indicating she needs to get back to her village even after moving to Riften. She will only use this dialogue now for as long as she's actually on Solstheim.</li>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>NPCs who beg will no longer do so once married to the player. (Bug #14771)</li>
<li>A scene between Jawanan and Jala (DialogueSolitudeMarketplaceJawananJalaScene) had no conditions on the second set of dialogue to make sure MS07 was completed. (Bug #14758)</li>
<li>A scene between Ataf and Jala (DialogueSolitudeMarketplaceAtAfAlanAdvarScene1) should not play if MS07 is completed. (Bug #14758)</li>
<li>Niranye had a line of after work dialogue which was impossible to use due to a bad condition check. (Bug #14750)</li>
<li>When the player is arrested and sent to the mines in Forsworn Conspiracy (MS01), the female orc jailor does not deliver the right line of dialogue due to a bad condition check. (Bug #14747)</li>
<li>Two dialogue options in the post quest for Ancestral Worship (dunHillgrundsTombQSTFIN) have been set so they only get said once instead of all the time. (Bug #14835)</li>
<li>Guard dialogue that is only meant to play when you're in front of the East Empire Company warehouse was playing wherever the guards were at due to the lack of a proper distance check from their patrol station marker.</li>
<li>Hidden quest dunPOIReachForswornRaidQST was stopping prematurely and resulting in errors. It has an associated object that handles quest shutdown in its OnUnload event. (Bug #14838) [NR]</li>
<li>CWFortSiegeCapital could select the wrong map marker to disable when setting up the city. This has now been corrected to always select the right one. (Bug #14775)</li>
<li>The alias for Bronzewater Cave in TGDungeonReserve needed to be set to optional since the Thieves Guild quest line is attemptng to clear the reservation. (Bug #14858)</li>
<li>Adelaisa Vendicci was still using greetings from MS10PostQuest after being recruited by the Blades. (Bug #14861)</li>
<li>Aranea Ienith still used the topic where she could be asked if Azura was still giving her visions after being recruited by the Blades. (Bug #14861)</li>
<li>Valdr will no longer trigger his script to keep him damaged when the quest has not started. Further, he will now no longer heal himself before the player has a chance to do so. (Bug #13901)</li>
<li>During Touching the Sky (DLC1VQ07) it is often possible to ask Serana to wait somewhere even though this is clearly not intended in the scripting. She is supposed to refuse when you ask her to wait somewhere for the duration of this quest. This was likely due to the previous quest's script (DLC1VQ06) not properly delaying things before DCL1VQ07 starts. The follower settings were ending up in an unreliable state as a result and once in waiting mode Serana could not be asked to follow again and would not be present for events requiring her. (Bug #4783, Bug #7297) (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/17286">BGS Support #17286</a>)</li>
<li>Hide and Seek (by way of DLC1Radiant) was incorrectly substituting advisors for merchants even though the quest dialogue doesn't support advisors. (Bug #14794)</li>
<li>DLC1VQ08PostGaranScene and DLC1VQ08PostIsranScene were both set to stop themselves in their very first phase condition check which results in errors passed to the log because the scenes have stopped running. (Bug #14819)</li>
<li>The brief scene where Serana comments on the smell of the Soul Cairn will now play more reliably. The trigger box has been moved farther down the steps. (Bug #14710)</li>
<li>DLC1DialogueFerrySystem was missing the property for the chatter topic. (Bug #14658)</li>
<li>The dialogue for purchasing Hearthfire house upgrades in Markarth was not linked to the option to continue buying more like the other house dialogue was. (Bug #14314)</li>
<li>Due to a bad condition check in dialogue, it was impossible for Mjoll (or any other male/female Nord spouses) to be asked how the children are doing if you are living in one of the Hearthfire homes.</li>
<li>In The Chief of Thirsk Hall (DLC2MH02), if you first bring Bilgemuck back to the Rieklings and then later turn on them, Bilgemuck is stuck hanging around the mead hall for no apparent reason. (Bug #14953)</li>
<li>A rumor at the Wretching Netch about the Rieklings could not be played until the quest had already been started, even though it's supposed to be what actually starts it. (Bug #14791)</li>
<li>After The Gardener of Men (DLC2MQ05), the body of Krosulhah is never cleaned up.</li>
<li>Miraak is supposed to have a few taunts based on the number of dragons you've killed but his dialogue is referencing the wrong tracking variable. (Bug #15014)</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The silver weapons script has been modified to add the perk to the player and then leave it alone after that. The actual perk has already been designed properly to check for the use of silver weapons.

<p class="h">v2.0.1 (2014-02-08)</p>

<li>The condition checks added for Bug #11996 to fix bards not being hireable needed to be corrected to account for the room in the house being upgraded in addition to just being present. (Bug #14156)</li>
</ul>

<b>UDBP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Dragonborn (DLC2MQ01) lost a property for cleaning up the cultist bodies after the ambush is over. DLC2WE09 also needed to be added for shutdown. (Bug #14121)</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>No navmesh existed in front of the main tower entrance to the Abandoned Prison. Followers could become lost trying to enter from the opposite side.</li>
<li>Soul Trap visuals will no longer stick to inanimate objects. (Bug #7167)</li>
<li>Soul Trap will no longer be castable on a dead NPC, which resulted in an endless exploit for conjuration gains. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Glitches#Skills">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>The navmesh in Largashbur Longhouse was bad. 3 islands had to be moved out of the main space and the main navmesh repaired because access to several beds was not possible. (Bug #14180)</li>
<li>The navmesh in Frostflow Abyss lacked jump down markers in the tall ice section near the Chaurus nest which prevented followers from being able to stay with the player.</li>
<li>Dwemer automatons (spiders, centurions, spheres) were not immune to disintegration. (Bug #13833)</li>
<li>Morokei needed a boss flag in order for Labyrinthian to be clearable. (Bug #14240)</li>
<li>Snow Veil Sanctum was not clearable because the boss creature did not have the boss flag. (Bug #14240)</li>
<li>Stonehills had some small breaks in the preferred navmesh pathing. (Bug #14224)</li>
<li>FrostflowLighthouseLocation had cave keywords on it which caused NPCs to comment about being in a cave when it's not. (Bug #13824)</li>
<li>Stendarr's Beacon was marked as clearable but should not be. LocTypeClearable has been removed from the location data. (Bug #12527)</li>
<li>PerkSoulStealerFFContact requires the same fixes as the normal Soul Trap effect in order to function properly. (Bug #14152)</li>
<li>EnchRobesFortifyMagickaRate04 and EnchRobesFortifyMagickaRate05 are improperly set to return EnchArmorFortifyMagickaBase instead of EnchArmorFortifyMagickaRateBase when disenchanted, resulting in getting the wrong learned effect from anything using these enchantments. (Bug #13625)</li>
<li>Force Without Effort (GreybeardsFusAbility) and The Fire Within (GreybeardsYolAbility) both incorrectly have a magnitude of 1.00 for health which results in an unintended continual healing effect. (Bug #13906)</li>
<li>The navmesh inside Alvor's house cut too close to the top of the stairs which resulted in NPCs getting stuck trying to turn to move into the main room. (Bug #14241)</li>
<li>Guard factions were hostile toward the temporary faction used for the High Hrothgar delegations which resulted in town guards attacking the delegations. (Bug #14172)</li>
<li>Olava and Saadia were fighting over the same marker position to listen to Heimskr preach. Saadia now has her own marker and package to prevent them from "marker fighting". (Bug #13445)</li>
<li>The AI packs for various Whiterun citizens who listened to Heimskr preach will no longer be active if he is jailed by the Imperials, or if he is dead.</li>
<li>The enchantment on StaffEnchReanimateCorpse was incorrectly set to use ReanimateFFAimed0. It should be using ReanimateFFAimed25. (Bug #14328)</li>
<li>Several Reanimate scroll enchantments were pointing to the wrong enchantment effects for their specified power levels. (Bug #14326)</li>
<li>Cell WhiterunAttackStart02 was assigned to the wrong location and would cause minor errors in the Battle of Whiterun. (Bug #14557)</li>
<li>Magic effects DA09EncDawnbreakerTurnUndeadFFMassSelfArea, dunReachwaterRockReforgeSpell, LightFFAimed, ReanimateFFAimed0, ReanimateFFAimed25, ReanimateFFAimed50, ReanimateFFAimed75, TurnUndeadFFAimed25, TurnUndeadFFAimed50, TurnUndeadFFAimed75, TurnUndeadFFAimedArea50, TurnUndeadFFAimedArea75, and TurnUndeadFFMassSelfArea were all missing the WICastNonHostileTimer and GameDaysPassed properties which would cause them to generate errors. (Bug #13701, Bug #14239)</li>
<li>More magic effects associated with creatures should now be prevented from attaching themselves to the player. (AbWitchlightScriptAttach, AbWispScriptAttach, AbWispShadeScriptAttach, AbFXAtronachFlame, AbFXAtronachStorm, AbFXSovengarde, AbFXDwarvenSpider, AbFXSkeletonNecro, AbFXSkeletonNecroPriest, AbSprigganSwarmScriptAttach, AbFXSpriggan, AbFXSprigganMatron, AbDragonPriestScriptAttach). An object has been placed in the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun that can be used in the future to remove any of these effects again should they somehow get past us.</li>
<li>Visual effect WerewolfExtractVFX didn't have the checkbox for rotating to face the target enabled. (Bug #13687)</li>
<li>The navmesh in TowerOfMzarkExterior was not complete and followers were unable to use the Great Lift because of it. (Bug #13141)</li>
<li>Weakness to Poison (AlchWeaknessPoison) had no corresponding keyword defined to match the other weakness effects. (Bug #13632)</li>
<li>Soul trapping black souls (NPCs) into the white version of Azura's Star has been mentioned as being impossible by in game dialogue, printed in game information sources, and all known lore from the TES series as well as published game guides. Regular black soul gems should also only accept the souls of NPCs (black souls) and is mentioned in all of the same lore material as being this way. This major discrepancy should now be fixed. Azura's Black Star and other regular black soul gems should now be the only ones able to trap black souls. (Bug #14194)</li>
<li>Corrected the perk applications for fortify enchant potions to conform to what the descriptions say you are getting. (Bug #14174)</li>
<li>Durnehviir is supposed to get a stats and abilities boost prior to his fight but because he's a persistent reference his OnInit() function runs when Dawnguard is first activated, which can mean he's nerfed entirely if it's activated on a player below level 20. His OnInit() block will now be explicitly called when he is enabled at the moment of the fight in the Soul Cairn. (Bug #14243)</li>
<li>The Aetherial Shield's bashing spell did not provide the 15 seconds duration that is described on its effects. (Bug #13903)</li>
<li>The castle mesh in the Volkihar Courtyard (CasExtMainTowerCourtyard01) needs the "Never Fades" flag set in order to keep it from fading out when the object view distance is short. (Bug #10371)</li>
<li>Magic effects for the Rings of Blood Magic (DLC1nVampireEnhancements) were being enabled for Lord Harkon in addition to the player even though these rings are only supposed to work for the player. (Bug #14244)</li>
<li>Harkon's gargoyle summoning was erroneously tied in to the player's bonus summoning provided by the Amulet of the Gargoyle. Harkon's spell will now summon the version that was created for him, which will, in turn, not inherit the script from the amulet version so that Harkon will not end up summoning two gargoyles, one of which is actually hostile to him. (Bug #14244)</li>
<li>The DLC1BatsEffect, used for when the player used the bat travel form, did not have the imagespace modifier property set. (Bug #13705)</li>
<li>Magic effect DLC1ReanimateFFAimed25 needed the GameDaysPassed and WICastNonHostileTimer properties set. (Bug #13701)</li>
<li>Magic effect DLC1VampireChangeFXEffect erroneously had the DLC1VampireChangeStagger property set to a none instead of the proper value. (Bug #13704)</li>
<li>DLC1RadiantVampireBanditNecroAllys was not set to ally with the factions the name implies, which could lead to battle royales in certain radiant dungeons and lead to possible death of rescue targets before the player had any chance to reach them. (Bug #14542)</li>
<li>DLC1CrystalAbsorbHealthConcAimed, DLC1CrystalAbsorbHealthConcAimedVisualFX, DLC1CrystalDamageHealRateConcAimed, and DLC1CrystalSlowConcAimed all had invalid properties still assigned in the ESM file that do not exist on the script. (Bug #14712)</li>
<li>Followers could not properly navigate Mosering Pass due to a bad section of navmesh. (Bug #14687)</li>
</ul>

<b>Animation Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Argonian tails would twist in a rather unrealistic (and painful looking) manner when sneaking. The backward animations file was copied, then renamed to use as the forward animation file. No visual functionality has been lost. (meshes\auxbones\tail\animations\sneakwalk_forward.hkx) (Bug #14068)</li>
<li>Sabre cat idle animation will no longer have them bobbing up and down unnaturally. (meshes\actors\sabrecat\animations\mt_idle.hkx) (Bug #13741)</li>
<li>Arch-Curate Vyrthur has a special idle animation he's supposed to use while seated in his chair in the chantry but it would not play due to an invalid condition check.</li>
<li>Serana has several idles under RomanticFollowerRoot that should not play if a shield or torch is equipped. The condition checks did not verify that her right hand was free of these in addition to her left. (Bug #14059)</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Vigilant Tyranus did not have the proper matching boots for his outfit.</li>
<li>Atub never leaves the longhouse in Largashbur and so her previous fix to correct the broken service factions was insufficient. She has been given a new package to send her to the proper marker, and her services faction has been changed to provide services in the proper location. (Bug #14178)</li>
<li>AI package EncCreatureSandboxEditorLocation512 has been edited to include the "allow idle chatter" flag which will correct the lack of clucking on chickens, and potentially on any other creatures which share this package. This supersedes the USKP 2.0.0 idle animation fix for chickens.</li>
<li>Sebastian Lort (DA03Wizard) respawns after being killed because the base NPC record was using the base template data that has the respawn flag checked. (Bug #14497)</li>
<li>Sebastian Lort also has the wrong voice type set. He should be using MaleWarlock. (Bug #14175)</li>
<li>The cultists and draugr in Wolfskull Cave were hostile toward each other. The two cultist NPC records are now in NecromancerFaction which should prevent this from happening. Previous fix for bug #1455 has been reverted out since it didn't address the problem for some reason. (Bug #14492)</li>
<li>Killing Drascua would result in future radiant quests to Dead Crone Rock failing since there is no generic boss replacement. A generic forsworn shaman boss has been placed near the word wall and given the boss flag. Drascua's boss flag has been removed so she will no longer count as a radiant target. (Bug #14485)</li>
<li>Actor dunPOIReachLoversCorpse01 is generic but should have been named according to the journal sitting next to her. She will also no longer respawn here. (Bug #14453)</li>
<li>Hilde had two patrol packages, one of which wasn't working properly. (Bug #14134)</li>
<li>Eola had the augmented frost perk despite using flame spells instead. (Bug #14128)</li>
<li>Jaree-Ra was placed in the wrong building and thus couldn't sleep in a bed. He should have been placed on the Red Wave instead along with Deeja. He has also been added to that faction so ownership won't bar him from using a bed. (Bug #14066)</li>
<li>Deeja cannot use the beds on the Red Wave because she is not part of the faction.</li>
<li>Asta (dunEldergleamPilgrimNordF) and Sond (dunEldergleamPilgrimNordM) were set to respawn if killed despite being uniquely named NPCs.</li>
<li><s>The guard spawners in Falkreath are too close to the fast travel marker and always spawn in a large bunch right in front of the player. These have now been moved to the area in front of the Jarl's longhouse in the center of the city where they can disperse more naturally. (Bug #14022)</s> [USSEP 4.0.5]</li>
<li>Guard spawners in Whiterun are all hovering in mid-air which results in them falling to the ground and taking damage if you fast travel to Dragonsreach instead of the front gate.</li>
<li>Sigdis and Mirkul Gauldurson could both be disintegrated and thus cause the quest they're in to become uncompletable. (Bug #14375)</li>
<li>Talsgar the Wanderer needed to be added to CR04Exclusion and CR08Exclusion to keep him from being picked for Companions radiant quests. (Bug #14160)</li>
<li>Sylgja was not linked to her bed which would lead to the player not picking up proper ownership of the marital bed. (Bug #14462)</li>
<li>DunValthumeGhostValdar and dunSnowyPOIGhost were erroneously given a script that does nothing. It's intention was to apply ghost abilities which are already present on the NPCs. (Bug #13997, Bug #13956)</li>
<li>Swanhvir did not have her CarryActorScript attached and could not perform her AI to carry firewood. (Bug #13954)</li>
<li>Two base bandit records for Mistwatch were not properly named for the location like the others. (dunMistwatchLvlBanditMelee1H, dunMistwatchLvlBanditMeleeOrcM) (Bug #14594)</li>
<li>GuardWhiterunSonsDragonsreachPorchPatrolB and GuardWhiterunSonsDragonsreachPorchPatrol were mislabeled as Whiterun Guards instead of Stormcloak Soldiers like all the others. (Bug #14568)</li>
<li>Madesi's vendor service faction hours in Riften did not match up with his assigned AI schedule. (Bug #14526)</li>
<li>Irnskar and Melaran are both supposed to "play bodyguard" to Bryling and Erikur when they're in the Blue Palace but due to linking errors and bad package conditions, they would do so throughout the whole city instead. (Bug #13544)</li>
<li><s>LvlDwarvenCenturionAmbush was not properly set as aggressive and would thus not attack the player even if standing next to them. (Bug #13195)</s> [USKP 2.0.4]</li>
<li>dunAlftandValie was incorrectly assigned to the Windhelm town faction which made her eligible to fill an alias in Blood on the Ice (MS11). She's not part of Windhelm. (Bug #14609)</li>
<li><s>Vigilant Tyranus was not a member of the Vigilants faction. (Bug #14605)</s> [USSEP 4.3.3]</li>
<li>All of the bandits at Fort Fellhammer had a script attached to them that would increment a Silver Hand kill counter for Purity of Revenge (C05) even when that quest is not running. This would result in later passing through on the way to do part of C05 and having the objectives update for the quest. (Bug #12058) [NR]</li>
<li>The orcs used at Rift Watchtower did not respawn properly which would lead to broken radiant quests at this location. (Bug #14618)</li>
<li>Gralnach is missing the key the USKP gave him due to a wild edit in the Hearthfire.esm file. (Bug #14112)</li>
<li>Ralis Sedarys (DLC2dunKolbjornRalias) mistakenly had the Augment Flames perk even though he has no flame spells. This should have been Augment Frost to go with his enchanted pickaxe. (Bug #14129)</li>
<li>Leveled list DLC2SubCharBandit05Magic is missing DLC2EncBandit05MagicDarkElf02F. (Bug #14041)</li>
<li>DLC2EncBandit03MissileDarkElf02F was missing her missile weapon and arrows. (Bug #14041)</li>
<li>Glover Mallory's vendor chest (DLC2RRGloverVendorChest) had an extra copy of the VendorGoldBlacksmith leveled list. (Bug #14603)</li>
</ul>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Dragon shout effect VoiceFrostBreathEffect3 was pointing to a fire breath sound instead of the proper frost breath sound. (Bug #14054)</li>
<li>MQ302CouncilSceneEnd has the wrong dialogue recorded for the Jarl names. (Sound\Voice\Skyrim.esm\MaleUniqueArngeir\MQ302__0004BA38_1.fuz, Sound\Voice\Skyrim.esm\MaleUniqueArngeir\MQ302__0004BA56_1.fuz, Sound\Voice\Skyrim.esm\MaleUniqueTullius\MQ302__00087643_1.fuz, Sound\Voice\Skyrim.esm\MaleUniqueUlfric\MQ302__0004BA51_1.fuz) (Bug #13876)</li>
<li>Melaran incorrectly refers to female players as males when asking about Court Wizards. (Sound\Voice\Skyrim.esm\MaleElfHaughty\DialogueSo_DialogueSolitud_000DD60B_1.fuz, Sound\Voice\Skyrim.esm\MaleElfHaughty\DialogueSo_DialogueSolitud_000DD60B_2.fuz) (Bug #13841)</li>
<li>Drifa has a line of dialogue referring to Bolli as her husband. She's married to Bersi. (Sound\Voice\Skyrim.esm\FemaleCommoner\DialogueRi__00046A92_1.fuz)</li>
<li>After Taking Care of Business, Drifa may have a conversation with Brand-Shei in the plaza where she indicates that Bolli was involved rather than her husband. She's married to Bersi. (Sound\Voice\Skyrim.esm\FemaleCommoner\DialogueRi__00063E44_1.fuz)</li>
<li>Ambarys will claim that Suvaris works for the Cruel-Seas, despite her not working for them. (Sound\Voice\Skyrim.esm\MaleDarkElf\DialogueWi__0003A8CC_1.fuz)</li>
<li>Dravin did not have recorded audio saying his wife's name during a scene at Merryfair Farm. (Sound\Voice\Skyrim.esm\MaleDarkElf\DialogueMe__00030269_1.fuz)</li>
<li>Several audio files are missing for post-wedding dialogue with some of the DLC changes. (Audio files: Sound\Voice\HearthFires.esm\FemaleCondescending\Relationsh_RelationshipMar_00003E62_1.fuz, Sound\Voice\HearthFires.esm\FemaleCoward\Relationsh_RelationshipMar_00003E62_1.fuz, Sound\Voice\HearthFires.esm\FemaleElfHaughty\Relationsh_RelationshipMar_00003E62_1.fuz, Sound\Voice\HearthFires.esm\FemaleSultry\Relationsh_RelationshipMar_00003E62_1.fuz, Sound\Voice\HearthFires.esm\MaleCondescending\Relationsh_RelationshipMar_00003E62_1.fuz, Sound\Voice\HearthFires.esm\MaleOrc\Relationsh_RelationshipMar_00003E5F_1.fuz, Sound\Voice\HearthFires.esm\MaleSlyCynical\Relationsh_RelationshipMar_00003E62_1.fuz) (Bug #14045)</li>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Deathbell had a duration of 20 seconds for the ravage stamina effect when all other ingredients with the same magnitude are set at 10 seconds. (Bug #14463)</li>
<li>The unique weapon, Woodsman's Friend (dunPinewoodGroveWoodsmansFriend) was set to respawn when it shouldn't. (Bug #14425)</li>

(Bug #14036)</li>
<li>LItemSpellTomes00Spells, LItemSpellTomes50Spells, and LItemSpellTomes75Spells have been reorganized to be consistent with how LItemSpellTomes25Spells is implemented. (Bug #14009)</li>
<li>Daedric maces do not use the correct 1st person model when wielded by the player. (Bug #13982)</li>
<li>BoundBowEnchantment does not have the flag to handle the Turn Undead effect properly when the Oblivion Binding perk is active. (Bug #13960)</li>
<li>CaveIRockL01, CaveIRockL02, CaveIRockL03, CaveIRockL04, and CaveIRockL05 had a directional angle setting of 60 degrees which was not enough to see the snow shader. They have all been raised to 120 degrees so the shader will be visible as intended. (Bug #13358)</li>
<li>The WETriggerOnLoad object did not have the WERoadStart keyword set as required. (Bug #13902)</li>
<li>Jala's vendor inventory in Solitude does not include gourds or garlic despite them being on display at her stand. (Bug #14588)</li>
<li>Trap activator DLC1TrapCrossbow did not have the "wind up" sound attached which resulted in errors sent to the log. (Bug #14449)</li>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Some portions of Birna's dialogue at the end of Drowned Sorrows (FreeformWinterholdC) still needed to be flagged for whether or not Ranmir was still around.</li>
<li>The dialogue for purchasing house upgrades in Markarth was not linked to the option to continue buying more like the other house dialogue was. (Bug #14314)</li>
<li>If Anise is killed, dunPOITundraWitchShackQST is never terminated and her body thus remains in the game forever. The quest can also be repeatedly triggered because the SM Event node was not checking to see if it was already running. (Bug #14193)</li>
<li>Alfhild Battle-Born does not use her greeting line if Jon is dead due to a bad condition check. (Bug #14087)</li>
<li>In the Eldergleam Sanctuary, if the two NPCs are killed then the controller quest (dunEldergleamT03) holding their aliases needs to be stopped so the bodies will eventually clean up. (Bug #14053)</li>
<li>The guards Irileth is supposed to dispatch to Riverwood get hung up on each other because their AI has them moving too closely together. (Bug #14016)</li>
<li>Lonely Gale will still talk about murders in the city even if Blood on the Ice (MS11) is completed. (Bug #13984)</li>
<li>Pickpocketing the key from Calixto allows access to knowing his true purpose in Blood on the Ice (MS11) without being able to tell anyone about it. His key will now be a death item instead of an inventory item. (NPCs don't require keys to their own homes) (Bug #14187)</li>
<li>Gaius Maro's travel and sleep schedule during Breeching Security (DB06) did not conform to the note that has his schedule on it. The sleep packages began at midnight which would cause him to end up traveling at night on the wrong day in order to reach the next city. All of the eat packages have been shortened to 4 hours and the sleep packages now begin at 22:00 and run for 8 hours so his schedule should be on track now. (Bug #13332)</li>
<li>The two random encounters capable of providing the player with a stray dog (WEJS18, WEJS23) will no longer cause the dog to disappear forever if the player leaves them somewhere and they unload from active memory. (Bug #11933) [NR]</li>
<li>The dead dragons and stray dog from random encounter WEJS18 were not being cleaned up by the script which could lead to minor save game bloating.</li>
<li>Ysolda and Camilla could both accept investments in their shops after being married, which makes little sense considering they're no longer going to be running the shops they are assigned as backups to. (Bug #14189)</li>
<li>Two scenes that deal with the murders in Windhelm (DialogueWindhelmViolaLonelyGaleScene1, DialogueWindhelmViolaLonelyGaleScene3) were still eligible to play once Blood on the Ice (MS11) was completed. (Bug #14242)</li>
<li>One of Endarie's responses to the player after completing The Wolf Queen Awakened (MS06) was incorrectly set to play after completing Lights Out! (MS07) instead. (Bug #14236)</li>
<li>Discerning the Transmundane (DA04) appears to have lost several properties due to unknown causes, possibly from bad official patches that have since been undone. Not many people seem to have been affected by this so it may have been caused by a Steam beta patch that went bad and was quickly corrected. These properties will now be restored allowing the quest to be completed. (Bug #13934)</li>
<li>When attempting to intimidate the bandits at Valtheim Keep (dunValtheimKeepQST) and failing, the bandits use a generic goodbye because the dialogue option failed to include the goodbye flag. (Bug #14520)</li>
<li>It was possible to turn in the 10 cogs for Arniel's Endeavor (MGRArniel01) before he had properly given you the quest due to a missing condition on the dialogue. (Bug #14481)</li>
<li>When persuading your way out of a random thief encounter (WERJ02) an incorrectly set invisible continue in the dialogue caused the goodbye flag to be ignored and the NPC to instead pick from any valid dialogue they could speak and use that instead. (Bug #14442)</li>
<li>When setting up the verses to present in court during Tending the Flames (MS05) one of the responses sets an incorrect variable resulting in a bad set of verses being played back. (Bug #14432)</li>
<li>Followers could use anti-vampire taunts while in combat and the player is the only vampire around. (Bug #14302)</li>
<li>The story manager had a second way to restart FreeformKolskeggrA which would then become stuck because of the previous USKP fix to disable the Forsworn respawns there. (Bug #14230)</li>
<li>All dialogue in "Gift from a friend" (WIChangeLocation05) is intended to be spoken by the NPC designated as your friend, but was available to every NPC in the loaded area. (Bug #14177)</li>
<li>Ardwen's random encounter (WEJS13) never terminates once she reaches Whiterun. The quest will now terminate if she has arrived and the player changes locations to anywhere other than Whiterun. (Bug #13916)</li>
<li>A Good Death (WE24) does not clean up properly because the Orc alias was misconfigured to never unload. (Bug #13900)</li>
<li>Random encounter "Bard at attacked by bandits" (WEDL01b) did not attach the cleanup script to the two bandit aliases and thus the encounter would never terminate properly once they had unloaded from local memory. (Bug #13945)</li>
<li>During The Wolf Queen Awakened (MS06) the quest marker for objective "Defeat Potema" does not display properly if the player is not in the second or third cell of the catacombs dungeon due to the first marker condition being invalid. (Bug #14165)</li>
<li>Persuasion responses used in Caught Red Handed (FreeformRiften11) were checking speech on the NPCs rather than on the player as other speech checks are. (Bug #14155)</li>
<li>King Olaf's Festival was intended to run every week, on Loredas (Saturday) once the initial quest to restore the festival was completed. To fix this, the following changes were required:
 <ul>
  <li>KingOlafsFestivalStarter needed 3 of its aliases set to optional since they're not even required anyway and two of the NPCs could be dead.</li>
  <li>Viarmo's alias in Tending the Flames (MS05KingOlafsFestival) needs to be set independently since his alias in MS05 will be invalid by this point.</li>
  <li>Viarmo's inventory would get a new torch every time this ran, so all the torches in his inventory will be taken from him when the quest shuts down.</li>
  <li>Stage 20 of MS05KingOlafsFestival will attempt to set stage 290 in MS05 each time it runs, but this only needs to be done once.</li>
 </ul>
(Bug #14140)
</li>
<li>Boethiah's Calling (DA02) breaks all future radiant quests which would take place at Knifepoint Ridge after the Champion has been enabled. (Bug #14131)</li>
<li>Tolfdir was supposed to describe the Auger's accident when you ask him about the Auger but the dialogue was not linked to the topic chain. (Bug #14107)</li>
<li>Telrav's Request (dunNilheimQST) is never stopped once Telrav is dead, leading to the location becoming blocked for radiant quests and the bandit bodies never respawning properly. This resolves several bugs which affect this quest. (Bug #885, Bug #13965, Bug #14199)</li>
<li>Repairing the Phial would not recognize BriarHeart objects sometimes, causing the quest to get stuck. The scripts were using an unreliable alias fill method which has now been rewritten. (Bug #14532)</li>
<li>During A Night to Remember (DA14) it was possible to persuade or bribe the priestess but then pick up the trash and have it give you the objective to apologize but be unable to do so, leaving the objective stuck there. The trash also never got disabled once you had left if you didn't pick it up. (Bug #14148)</li>
<li>When purchasing the cleanup option for Hjerim to get rid of the murderer's mess (MS11), entering the house could cause a black screen and full freeze if the chest had anything added to it by the player. Even if it was the original contents. The chest has now been unlinked from the enable parent marker and will remain behind when the mess is removed. (Bug #14035) (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/16605">BGS Support #16605</a>)</li>
<li>During the embassy party in Diplomatic Immunity (MQ201) a scene between Orthus and Vittoria will attempt to play out even if Orthus isn't nearby because Vittoria's AI is targeting the player instead of Orthus. (Bug #13596)</li>
<li>When NPCs accept the generic items in Delivery (Favor001) they can end up selling them back to the player if they are a merchant. (Bug #13541)</li>
<li>One scene in Narzulbur has Mauhulakh and Dushnamub (DialogueNarzulburMauhulakhDushnamub2) had the two speakers each using the lines belong to the other. (Bug #14197)</li>
<li>Ogmund should be sent to the stockade after turning over his Talos amulet to the Thalmor but isn't because the stage check to see when this should happen was pointing to the wrong quest. (Bug #14139)</li>
<li>Tolfdir the Absent-Minded (MGR01) does not clear all objectives properly if the alembic is picked up before he gives you the quest. (Bug #13760)</li>
<li>Upon completion of The Break of Dawn (DA09) the light beams outside of Kilkreath Ruins should be shut down but are not. (Bug #865)</li>
<li>Prisoners being escorted by Stormcloaks/Thalmor (WE09/WE32) will be properly unbound if the player frees them through dialogue. If the player "frees" them by killing the escorts, the prisoner will be properly unbound once they begin to flee the area and will not require the player to speak to them first. (Bug #12994)</li>
<li>The prisoner being escorted by Imperial guards (WE09) did not receive the proper crime faction for crime detection if assaulted.</li>
<li>When completing The Cure for Madness (DB07) the blood outside of the Dawnstar Sanctuary is never removed. (Bug #14208)</li>
<li>The first puzzle door in High Gate Ruins did not reset correctly if you failed, making it possible to resolve it with a shortcut. Two draugr on the next level have also been fixed so they can't shout at you from behind a wall until it's appropriate for them to be active. (Bug #13438)</li>
<li>Ulfric's map scene quest (CW01WindhelmMapTableScene) was missing a property to ensure that the Jagged Crown scene was fully played out. (Bug #14525)</li>
<li>Erdi does not process the persuasion prompt correctly because the property is missing on the dialogue script. (Bug #14553)</li>
<li>Senna does not process the persuasion prompt correctly because the property is missing on the dialogue script. (Bug #14426)</li>
<li>When a witch head is chosen for the Purity quest (CR13), it is routinely impossible for the alias to fill properly due to internal changes in Papyrus that can no longer properly handle the player's inventory items. A new head will now be generated, the alias filled, and then swapped with one of the ones the player is carrying. This should eliminate problems with CR13 repeatedly trying to reset itself and with any complaints from C04GlenmorilWitchHeadScript. These changes should also eliminate the problem of CR13 not taking the head from your inventory upon curing the person you were asked to help. (Bug #14212, Bug #12983)</li>
<li>The finale scene for Dead Man's Respite (MS05_dunDeadMensRespiteQST) could not play out properly due to a missing alias property in MS05_BardGhostFinale. (Bug #14311)</li>
<li>Guard rumors in Markarth were not able to add the map marker for Reachwater Rock because the dialogue option had the wrong property set. (Bug #14301)</li>
<li>When being sent to do Hired Muscle (CR04), if the target had another possible response from a different quest they would use that instead and leave CR04 dangling. Sometimes this would result in brawl opponents paying off a reward a second time even though they aren't supposed to do that. This was due to the CR04 alias dialogue response being at the bottom of the available list of choices. It has now been moved to the top where it will function correctly. (Bug #14252)</li>
<li>Using speech to intimidate or persuade the random mercenaries (WE06Road) was not working correctly because the dialogue options did not have the properties set. (Bug #14219)</li>
<li>When Malacath gives Yamarz his task, the scene dialogue does not disable the hammer as expected due to the property not being set. (Bug #14163)</li>
<li>In Good Intentions (MG04) Quaranir's alias did not have the quest property set so he could disable as needed when stage 40 was done. (Bug #14006) [NR]</li>
<li>Thane of Hjaalmarch (Favor255) had the wrong value set for the objective display property. (Bug #13961)</li>
<li>Two aliases in Under Saarthal (MG02) did not have a property set for disabling a collision object. (Bug #13987, Bug #13986) [NR]</li>
<li>Guards are never enabled at the Western Watchtower after the Battle of Whiterun. (Bug #14569)</li>
<li>Warlord Gathrik is not properly reserved when Coming of Age (dunIronbindQST) starts and thus another radiant quest could override his alias that stores his unique name. (Bug #14555)</li>
<li>When asking for access to the Pelagius Wing during The Mind of Madness (DA15) persuading Una to let you in does not provide you with the appropriate speech skill increase due to a missing property and missing persuasion fragment. She also lacked proper conditions for the speech check. (Bug #14554)</li>
<li>The guards outside the Solitude gate would still tell you how to join the legion even if you had already joined the Stormcloaks. (Bug #14590)</li>
<li>dunRebelsCairnQST would fail to start if the boss had been reserved by another radiant quest, or if the note there had already been taken by the player. (Bug #14166)</li>
<li>It was possible to have your spouse start handing out profits before ever moving to your house and informing you they're opening a store. (Bug #14188)</li>
<li>Farengar's goodbye dialogue in Bleak Falls Barrow (MQ103) played over the top of Balgruuf's closing parts of the scene making it difficult or impossible to tell what either one of them were saying. (Bug #14149)</li>
<li>dunMistwatchQST had a missing property for the ChristerLeavesWorld scene. (Bug #14593)</li>
<li>In the random encounter "Taunting Adventurer" (WERoad07) the speech options for persuade and intimidate don't work because the script properties were not set. (Bug #14585)</li>
<li>dunBloodletThroneQST never terminates once stage 200 is reached. (Bug #14586)</li>
<li>During the retrieval of the Crown of Barenziah several scenes involving ghosts should play. Due to poor design, the final scene at the crown itself will never play and often result in only one Dunmer ghost appearing who does not go hostile as intended. (Bug #14441)</li>
<li>Several aliases in WERJ10, WERJ11, and WERJ12 had redundant cleanup scripts on them that the quests are already handling. (Bug #13929)</li>
<li>The TortureRoomStormcloak1 alias in Unbound (MQ101) was marked as disabled when it should not have been, which results in errors trying to enter it into combat. (Bug #13849)</li>
<li><s>It was possible to prematurely start Valdr's healing checks before the Moss Mother quest (dunMossMotherQST) was actually running. (Bug #13901)</s> [USKP 2.0.2]</li>
<li>During Prophet (DLC1VQ03Hunter or DLC1VQ03Vampire) it was possible for Dexion to escape the barrier prematurely and become permanently hostile to the player if he had. This was due to his alias in both quests not placing him in the dunPrisonerFaction to keep him friendly with everyone. It was also possible for his bleedout event script to run before it was ready which would block it from running again at the right time and leave him permanently stuck on the ground. (Bug #14522)</li>
<li>Serana's dismissal dialogue would indicate she's returning to places she shouldn't be going to anymore once the quests were complete due to incomplete condition checks on the quest stages. (Bug #14034)</li>
<li>Lost to the Ages (DLC1LD) would not start if the player had visited Mzulft or Deepfolk Crossing prior to reading The Aetherium Wars. Two corpses placed at these locations were added, but they were not considered optional for the quest aliases, and once they "rotted" this blocked the quest from starting. (Bug #14130)</li>
<li>"Hide and Seek" (DLC1RH01) could not set the crime faction for the target because the alias property was not set. (Bug #14431)</li>
<li>Three dialogue responses in DLC1RadiantDisguised needed to have properties cleared that were no longer on the scripts. (Bug #14570)</li>
<li>In Vampire Assassin (DLC1_WESC04), the alias holding the assassin's writ should have had a script attached to advance the stage if read while the quest was running. Instead, the base object had this script and if the writ was read after the quest shut down, it would do nothing but error out. (Bug #13951)</li>
<li>During Bloodline (DLC1VQ02), when Harkon is explaining his gift to the player, Imperial vampires are not recognized due to a missing condition check. These conditions have been replaced with checks that instead use the "Vampire" keyword. As a bonus, this should now make Harkon recognize properly configured vampires for custom races as well. (Bug #14547)</li>
<li>The house builder control quest (BYOHHouseBuilding) did not have the property set for cut logs which resulted in the planned inventory filter failing to apply. This lead to potential script overload and stack dumps. This property had already been restored but was accidentally left out of our retroactive fix scripts. (Bug #14150)</li>
<li><s>BYOHHousePale had incorrect steward settings that mirrored the Jarls. (Bug #14017) [NR]</s> [UHFP 2.0.5]</li>
<li>If Brina Merilis is Jarl of Dawnstar, she will offer you Heljarchen Hall as though you had already asked about it due to the dialogue responses all being in the wrong order.</li>
<li>One of the dialogue options for BYOHHouseBanditAttack2 failed to call the necessary quest stage to remove the AI restraint on your spouse once they had been rescued. (Bug #9154)</li>
<li>Despite being able to run a shop from one of the Hearthfire properties, your spouse never actually says they're going to do this if this is the first house you move them to because the dialogue conditions did not include the HF locations. (Bug #14188)</li>
<li>Filial Bonds (DLC2WB01) was missing the alias property for the journal chest. (Bug #14357)</li>
<li>The word wall found in Kolbjorn Barrow was erroneously tied to an enable parent. The quest scripting has been modified to separate this word wall out into its own enable statement so the word wall can properly disable itself once the word is learned. (Bug #14523)</li>
<li>Two trigger boxes in Vahlok's Tomb were tied to an enable parent but should not have been. The alias in Lost Legacy (DLC2SV01) has been changed from the original parent marker to the trigger which is setup to be the proper parent marker. (Bug #14358) [NR]</li>
<li>Teldryn Sero's idle commentary was missing random flags for the random entries. (Bug #14664)</li>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The following scripts have been modified to attempt to address longstanding issues with bloat from spawned critters: Critter, critterBird, critterDragonFly, critterFish, critterMoth, CritterSpawn, FireFly, FXfakeCritterScript. In addition, they will also address the following issues:
 <ul>
  <li>Critter.psc was throwing errors about being unable to move spawned critters to their dummy markers. (Bug #13551)</li>

<li>CarryActorScript was set up to extend ObjectReference, but something in Patch 1.9 changed how Papyrus views attempts to upcast an ObjectReference into an Actor (it usually just fails).

This should resolve numerous bugs with carry package that litter the Papyrus logs. (Bug #14206)</li>

<li>Lurbuk had no generic sandbox package at the Moorside Inn. (Bug #13148)</li>
<li>Nura Snow-Shod could not sleep because RiftenNuraSleeps0x6 had too small a radius on it. (Bug #13074)</li>
<li>Thadgeir's persistence location was set incorrectly which caused his AI schedule to be unreliable. His sleep package radius was also too small to reach a bed. (Bug #13058)</li>

<li>The "Sultry Maiden" found in Sheogorath's realm had several factions attached that she didn't need, causing her to randomly generate idle topics. She was also set to use a male voice type, and had a broken set of facegen data. (Bug #13383)</li>
<li>When the previous fix for cave bears was done to make them black as intended, regular bears should have been changed to be brown. Currently all bears other than snow bears are black so this will restore the proper distribution of bears in the game. (Bug #13823)</li>
<li>Sabre cats, snowy sabre cats, foxes, and snow foxes were not set to respawn despite no in-game reason for this to be so. This would eventually lead to many spawn points in the world becoming depleted if they had last spawned one of these 4 creatures. (Bug #13844)</li>
<li>Several Forsworn bosses are using an incorrect combat style which prevents them from being able to dual-wield. The following base NPCs are now using the csForswornBerserker (or csForswornBerserkerLow) combat style to correct this: EncForsworn06TemplateBossMelee, EncForsworn04TemplateBossMelee, and EncForsworn03TemplateBossMelee.

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Hrefna has been given a new bed type to replace the bed she's supposed to use in Darkwater Crossing so she can execute her sleep package - without being stretched out by a normal bed. (Bug #13391)</li>

<li>Activator objects TrapPressurePlateSkyhaven01, TrapPressurePlateSkyhaven02, TrapPressurePlateSkyhaven03, TrapPressurePlateSkyhaven04, and TrapPressurePlateSkyhaven05 are all missing various properties which impede their functionality and spew out hundreds of log errors because of it.

</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The Companions radiant quests were capable of generating save game bloat due to improperly handling the recycling of the quests whenever the player visited Whiterun. In a long enough game, it would have been possible to generate substantial amounts of dynamically created objects and NPCs which were never properly cleaned up. Quests CR06, CR07, CR10, and CR11 were responsible for generating these potential bloat bombs. In order to correct this, ALL of the CRxx quests now have an added stage 255 and the 4 capable of generating bloat now have code to manually clean up their messes. The new stage 255 will be called by CycleRadiantQuests() in the Companions housekeeping script. (Bug #13958)</li>
<li>Repairing the Phial (MS12b) would not start if the Briarheart Warrior boss for the Red Eagle quest had already been killed beforehand. An alias on MS12b was requiring him to be alive. This alias is now marked optional since it is not necessary for that one particular Briarheart Warrior to be the target. Yes, this means if you're stuck waiting on the courier who never shows up, he should be much more agreeable to that now. (Bug #1086)</li>
<li>Fetch me that Book! (MGR20B) had a flaw in the scripting that never added the book to the target chest. The quest also would not acknowledge if you already had a copy of the book in your posession. Note that this is the book quest you get from Urag the SECOND time. The first one uses the same name but has a separate quest entry and was working properly. (Bug #13745)</li>
<li>Aerin will still perform scenes with Mjoll even if she's no longer in Riften due to being married or recruited by the Blades. (Bug #13521)</li>
<li>Sanguine is never disabled after A Night to Remember (DA14) and will reset back to Morvunskar after the quest is stopped. (Bug #13489)</li>
<li>DialogueCompanionsFarkasTorvar1, DialogueCompanionsKodlakTorvar1, and DialogueCompanionsKodlakAela2 could all play even if Skjor were dead despite the scenes speaking as though he was still alive. (Bug #13223)</li>
<li>Korir could be found wandering between Windhelm and Winterhold after being exiled if Containment (MG05) was running. (Bug #13139)</li>
<li>The restoration ritual quest (MGRitual04) can become stuck in an endless update loop. (Bug #13631)</li>
<li>Patch 1.9 was supposed to remove Karliah's invisibility spell when Speaking With Silence (TG05) was completed but the script did not have the necessary statement to do so. TG06 also had a missing property warning for TG06QuestScript that had been shifted to TG06 stage 10 instead. (Bug #13471)</li>
<li>The blood extractor perk for Discerning the Transmundane (DA04) is not always properly cleared if Septimus is killed before the end. (Bug #13634)</li>
<li>Mammoth Tusk Powder required for Repairing the Phial (MS12b) was not marked as a quest object and could easily be lost. (Bug #13235) [NR]</li>
<li>Dialogue for Sky Haven Temple (DialogueSkyHavenTemple) was only supposed to be used by Blade recruits when at the temple. Patch 1.9 removed the condition which then breaks recruit responses outside of the temple if they are your current follower. (Bug #13216)</li>
<li>It was not possible to invest in Zaria's or Lod's shops in Falkreath due to the global variables being missing, the leveled lists being missing, and the dialogue not being assigned to them. (Bug #13215)</li>
<li>Muiri's dialogue response for accepting an investment was pointing to the wrong shared dialogue entry. (Bug #13214)</li>
<li>Calcelmo's dialogue response for accepting an investment was pointing to the wrong shared dialogue entry. (Bug #13213)</li>
<li>Elgrim's dialogue response for accepting an investment was pointing to the wrong shared dialogue entry. (Bug #13212)</li>
<li>The scene between Ranmir and Haran about Korir (DialogueWinterholdInnScene04) should not be played if Winterhold is under Stormcloak control. (Bug #13188)</li>
<li>Talking to Malborn again after he's leaving Windhelm after MQ201Malborn would result in him repeating the quest intro dialogue due to missing condition checks. (Bug #13115)</li>
<li>Movarth is not disabled after Laid to Rest (MS14) which results in him respawning the next time the cell resets. (Bug #13151)</li>
<li>Romlyn Dreth was supposed to get arrested and sent to jail if you turned him in during Under the Table (FreeformRiften03). He will now be jailed as expected and his dialogue to sell mead will be disabled once he's there. (Bug #12361)</li>
<li>Proventus Avenicci equips the greatsword that was intended to be for Balgruuf in FreeformWhiterunQuest03. It will now simply be taken from the player instead and placed in a display case in Balgruuf's quarters as was implied. (Bug #9040)</li>
<li>The quest controlling scenes aboard the Katariah (DB11_dunKatariahQST) does not start properly due to a bad story manager node condition. (Bug #13679)</li>
<li>Thane of Falkreath (Favor258) had the wrong value set for the objective display property. (Bug #13642)</li>
<li>Thane of Winterhold (Favor257) had the wrong value set for the objective display property. (Bug #13642)</li>
<li>Thane of the Pale (Favor256) had the wrong value set for the objective display property. (Bug #13645)</li>
<li>Under New Management (TGLeadership) was missing a property assignment that caused it to fail to advance the quest to stage 50, which is supposed to move Karliah and Maven Black-Briar to their positions for the next stages of the quest. (Bug #13715)</li>
<li>If a carriage driver is not seated for some reason when approached for a ride, he will still offer it, but will end up seating himself wherever you happen to be. A condition check to make sure he's seated properly has been added to prevent this. (Bug #13686)</li>
<li>Shalidor's Insights (MGR21) starts the game enabled but this allows it to choose from reserved locations, potentially sticking the target behind a quest locked dungeon. The quest will instead be started when you join the College of Winterhold so this issue won't crop up again. (Bug #13759, Bug #13130)</li>
<li>A scene from Blood on the Ice (MS11 - GO DIE DAMMIT!) where Calixto's final victim cries for help (MS11CalixtoAttackLastVictim) can only be spoken by one voice type. This has now been changed to a generic shared bystander shout so all of the potential victims can use it. (Bug #13814)</li>
<li>The Heart of Dibella (T01) conclusion scene when returning the Sybil never plays, and after you receive your reward the quest is never stopped either. (Bug #13744)</li>
<li>The wilderness encounter with the Aspiring Mage (WE31) would never complete properly, the mage wasn't equipping the staff for his scene, and he wasn't giving the staff to the player like he said he would. (Bug #13890)</li>
<li>Birna's dialogue after the end of Drowned Sorrows (FreeformWinterholdC) should change to mention (albiet vaguely) that Ranimr is gone but it doesn't due to bad condition checks. (Bug #13911)</li>
<li>Kindred Judgment (DLC1VQ08) will not start on the vampire side of the quest if either of the two hireable Deathhounds have been killed and their bodies have been removed from the game. (Bug #10691)</li>
<li>In New Allegiances (DLC1RV07) Vingalmo talks about Haran running the inn in the shadow of the mages guild. There is no mages guild in Skyrim, only the College. His subtitles and audio have been corrected to reflect this. (Audio file: Sound\Voice\dawnguard.esm\maleelfhaughty\DLC1RV07_DLC1RV07StartCont_00014349_1.fuz) (Bug #13437)</li>
<li>The bodies of the Volkihar vampires are never cleared once Kindred Judgment is completed because their base dialogue quest is never stopped after they're all dead. (Bug #13387)</li>
<li>After Kindred Judgment is completed on the vampire side, Garan will ask if you want the courtyard entry restored. None of the response options you can pick will exit the dialogue even though they should. (Bug #13795)</li>
<li>The USKP had accidentally clobbered some properties on PlayerVampireQuest that were used for vampire feeding, causing errors to show up in the logs and possibly impede the results of feeding on an NPC. (Bug #13706, Bug #13443)</li>
<li>A Jarl's Justice (DLC1RH07) could only pick Dawnstar or Riften as targets because the Jarls in every other city were in reserved aliases. The quest should now be able to choose a target from any hold capital.</li>
<li>Wolf attacks on the player's homes did not work properly due to missing property settings in BYOHHouseWolfAttack. (Bug #13747)</li>
<li>While the quest Retaking Thirsk (DLC2MH01) is running, combat taunts would not play due to a combat taunt dialogue in the quest that has no conditions. (Bug #13574)</li>
<li>Combat taunts used by bandits and/or reavers had no condition checks on them which resulted in Dark Elves being taunted as outlanders and being taunted about boots even if the target isn't wearing any. (Bug #13693)</li>
</ul>

<li>Soul Trap animations would not play for bound weapons after obtaining the Soul Stealer perk (PerkSoulStealerFFContact) due to the perk not having the effect script attached. (Bug #901)</li>
<li>Weapon/shield racks and display cases have received a major overhaul to fix numerous bugs:
 <ul>
  <li>Eliminated all issues with cross-activation of racks by large weapons placed on adjacent racks, which led to all sorts of glitches (racks becoming inoperative although empty, activators getting enabled although the racks were filled and making it impossible to retrieve the weapons placed on them, etc.). Cross-activation was notoriously an issue with crossbows and large battleaxes on wooden racks, and with pretty much every item on the red wall-mounted three-in-one racks ("CoA racks"); shield plaques staying inactive when the shield was grabbed from an otherwise fully occupied rack was a common issue.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue with pre-placed shields and weapons, which were moved back to their starting position upon reload whenever they were placed somewhere else (not even necessarily on a rack) in the same cell. This was because the starting item is never unlinked from the rack it was placed on and because the scripts never checked whether the starting items had been grabbed but repeated to handle (and place) them on every cell attach. (Bug #914)</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where the activator would stay enabled when the trigger was disabled. It will now properly disable itself when its linked trigger is disabled (this happens e.g. to most of the racks in military camps).</li>
  <li>Caught all mistakenly enable-parented activators and fixed them (54 in total)</li>
  <li>Fixed also an issue where some of these racks were linked to a wrong enable parent (bug #13189)</li>
  <li>Items that should not be put on any racks are now handled by a form list. This makes it a lot easier to add or remove items in the future, as it will not require to modify the scripts again. (Bug #148)</li>
  <li>Added full support for crossbows.</li>
  <li>Added collision flags to all new item placement nodes that were missing them.</li>
  <li>Adjusted placement of the Falmer staff on wooden racks (rotated it slightly out of plane) since there was clipping when another Falmer staff was mounted on an adjacent rack.</li>
  <li>Modified the position of other staves on wooden racks, since some of them were ending up much higher on the rack than planned originally.</li>
  <li>Fixed clipping issue with the Falmer staves on both plaques (left and right) of the CoA racks, which required modifications to another two trigger meshes.</li>
  <li>Fixed placement of the forsworn staves on the red wall-mounted single-weapon plaques, but had to exclude them from being placed in the large display cases (temporarily at least, until I have found out why they ignore the rotation values I set on their pivot and always end up in the same wrong position).</li>
  <li>Meshes modified to support the above changes: Meshes\Clutter\WeaponRack\WRPlaqueShield01.nif, Meshes\Clutter\WeaponRack\WRSingle01.nif, Meshes\Clutter\WeaponRack\WRDisplayCase01.nif, Meshes\Clutter\WeaponRack\WRPlaque01.nif, Meshes\Clutter\WeaponRack\WRPlaqueLeft01.nif, Meshes\Clutter\WeaponRack\WRPlaqueRight01.nif</li>

<li>The LvlPredatorScript has been corrected so that it will no longer fill the logs with errors about enable parents. The addition of two new USKP-specific keywords was required for this in addition to editing several world records for the placed creatures the script was intended to run for. In an 100% vanilla game, this completely eradicates these error messages and the predator/prey setups now work as they were intended to. Mods which edit these references will cancel out the fixes for them and we cannot correct for this.</li>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>During The Only Cure (DA13) it is possible to kill Orchendor yet have the quest fail to advance. If this has already happened and you left the dungeon, the retroactive script will notify you. If you installed the USKP and THEN run the quest and encounter this bug, simply leave the dungeon and visit other locations. You should get a notification before long advancing the quest.</li>
<li><s>Work on the broken ending scene in Unfathomable Depths (MS04) has been completed thanks to Hexaae. The scene and some dialogue had some nonsensical conditions which were preventing it from running correctly.</s> [USKP 2.0.0]</li>
<li>If interrupted, Cicero and/or the other DB initiates will not execute commands to wait or be dismissed due to their scripts being set to fire at the end of the dialogue instead of the beginning. (Bug #12967)</li>
<li>Skjor displays two topics for the player to as what Wuuthrad is. The second option was lacking the appropriate player race checks to block it with. (Bug #12930)</li>
<li>Sayma repeats her greeting dialogue to the player about being there for Roggvir's execution due to the greeting not having the Say Once flag. (Bug #12877)</li>
<li>Two lines for Dirge lacked conditions to keep them from playing after you had become Guildmaster for the Thieves Guild. (Bug #12875)</li>
<li>Ulfberth War-Bear's dialogue about where he gets the weapons and armor plays even if he's not in the shop. (Bug #12816)</li>
<li>Hert has one line of dialogue which isn't appropriate if Hern is dead. The line was checking to see if Hern was disabled, but not also checking to see if he'd been killed. (Bug #12800)</li>
<li>The scene between Yngvar and Tyranus in Markarth that introduces The House of Horrors (DA10) would cause Yngvar to warp back from Windhelm if he was exiled as a result of the civil war. (Bug #12621)</li>

<li>When entering Ysgramor's Tomb, placing Wuuthrad on the statue and then taking it back results in the player getting a new copy of the axe rather than the existing one they had and might have tempered. Note that if you've already put it on the statue, this fix will not take effect. (Bug #12911)</li>
<li>There are 11 Winterhold College scenes that will never play because the event node conditions were making too narrow a check on where the participants could be for the scenes to start. (Bug #12909)</li>
<li>It was not possible to reconcile jilting an Argonian lover at the altar due to a lack of dialogue responses for making up. (Bug #12878)</li>

<li>AI packs WE25HunterForceGreet and WE25FugitiveGreetPlayer will delay forcegreeting if the player is in combat when the event triggers. (Bug #12854)</li>
<li>AI pack C02QuestGiverWaitForPlayer attached to Proving Honor (C02) prevents Vilkas from greeting the player after returning with the Wuuthrad fragment. This was due to a change made by an official patch which broke the conditions the package is using. (Bug #12850)</li>
<li>Summerset Shadows (TGTQ04) does not return Uttering Hills Cave to normal once the Shadows have been eliminated which then breaks any radiant quests that use the location. (Bug #12832)</li>

<li>Standing around long enough outside High Hrothgar on the way to the peace conference for Season Unending (MQ302) would start either Balgruuf or Vignar walking back to Whiterun even though the one walking back wasn't supposed to be there to start with. (Bug #12717)</li>
<li>Calcelmo's Tower is supposed to unlock during Hard Answers (TG06) but doesn't. (Bug #12165)</li>
<li>A second back door trigger method for Legend of Red Eagle (dunRebelsCairnQST) was spawning the quest if you visited either Rebel's Cairn or Red Eagle Redoubt. (Bug #13020)</li>
<li>In A Daedra's Best Friend (DA03), speaking to Barbas after telling Vile to take him back but before he turns to stone will no longer be possible since it would break the ending entirely. (Bug #241) [NR]</li>
<li>Fixed the exit scene at Forelhost (dunForelhostQST) so that Valmir and the real soldier will not have their conversation unless the player is on the ground in the same area with them. It would break progression if it took place while up on the balcony by the world wall. (Bug #920) [NR]</li>
<li>During Infiltration (dunTrevasWatchQST) if the player had previously cleared the dungeon and opened the front gate before the quest starts, it would still make you repeat everything. (Bug #1110) [NR]</li>
<li>At the completion of White Phial (MS12), Nurelion needs to be added to the TGNoPickpocketFaction faction so that he will not be selected as a future mark for a pickpocket quest. If he is already the mark and MS12 is completed before you pick his pocket, you'll need to go tell Delvin you don't want that job anymore. (Bug #1453)</li>
<li>Maramal would repeat the introductory marriage dialogue due to a bad condition in his dialogue when the player first asks about marriage. (Bug #6788)</li>
<li>Harsh Master (FreeformShipsWindhelm) would generate the boss NPC prior to the player actually receiving the quest from Kjar, which could result in the player killing the NPC and then getting told to return to someone they'd never visited. (Bug #8316)</li>
<li>If Anska is killed during A Scroll For Anska (dunHighGateRuinsQST) the quest does not fail as it should.</li>
<li>Two of Adrianne's dialogue greetings speak of her father as though he's still Steward even after the Stormcloaks take Whiterun. (Bug #13031)</li>
<li>At the end of the Helgen dragon attack (MQ101DragonAttack) Vilod and Matlara are left alive and can be seen wandering Helgen after it's been destroyed. All other NPCs have been disabled at this point and their OnUnload event does not reliably remove them. (Bug #4043)</li>
<li>Hulda (and all the other innkeepers too - even modded ones) would fail to headtrack the player upon entering the building due to the WITavernGreeting scene in WITavern not having headtracking set at all. (Bug #63)</li>

<li>Farengar will no longer use his dialogue line about ongoing hostilities once the civil war is over. (Bug #12874)</li>
<li>The Thalmor disguise option that was supposed to be made available during Diplomatic Immunity (MQ201) will now work as intended. Altmer players can now disguise themselves using hooded or unhooded Thalmor robes or elven armor, other races still must have hooded robes. (Bug #12852)</li>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>

<li>WICourierScript has more sanity checking added to eliminate more problems with NONE locations.</li>
<li>TrapFlamethrower has inadequate safeguards for checking to see if the 3D is loaded. It can get permanently stuck in its Wait() loop even after you've left the cell containing an object using it. This results in storing numerous suspended Papyrus stacks in your save. [NR]</li>
<li>FXSetBlendVariableScript will become stuck in its while loop due to insufficient safeguards against the object being unloaded from memory. [NR]</li>
<li>dunPOIRaiders will become stuck in its while loop due to insufficient safeguards against the object being unloaded from memory. [NR]</li>
<li>dunSerpentsBluffPressurePlate will become stuck in its while loop due to insufficient safeguards against the object being unloaded from memory. [NR]</li>
<li>Firefly.psc had no onCellDetach event to clean up fireflies if the player suddenly exited the cell, potentially leading them to build up over time and cause bloat.</li>
<li>Combining fixes from Steve40 and Inki, the Critter.psc script should no longer dump mountains of log spam AND should no longer have the potential for building up save bloat due to unhandled critter deletions. (Bug #12978)</li>
<li>CritterFish.psc should no longer dump mountains of spam to the logs and should no longer have the potential to leave unhandled fish deletions which could contribute to save bloat over time. Thanks to Steve40. (Bug #12978)</li>
<li>It was possible for WordWallTrigger02Script to switch to the "done" state without disabling its associated trigger. The disable statement is now handled when the "done" state starts.</li>
<li>dunHalldirMistClearing had no sanity checking for missing custom links which resulted in it spamming the Papyrus log with repeated attempts. (Bug #12502)</li>
<li>More noisy scripts have had their debug messages commented out.</li>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>

<li>Dawnguard generated two wild edits on the Fireball and Conjure Flame Atronach spells. The Fireball edit raised the casting cost to an absurd 133 points. The Flame Atronach edit reduced the charge time to 0. Neither of these edits have any visible basis for being made so the vanilla Skyrim values have been restored. (Bug #12986)</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The summoned version of Durnehviir (DLC1DurnehviirSummon) generates dynamic references each time he is summoned. These refences then leave behind running scripts which become permanently stuck in the Papyrus stack, attempting to wait for the player to close to soul absorption distance. This can never happen though because Durnehviir never actually dies. The more times he is summoned, the more of these events would be built up on the suspended stacks list. A new script based on the DragonActorScript has been created for him that removes this issue entirely. Unfortunately due to how Papyrus works, this cannot retroactively fix any currently executing copies of his unmodified script. It can only prevent new instances of it from occurring. (Bug #12992) [NR]</li>
<li>Four NPCs, whose purpose is unknown, can be found standing around outside Fort Dawnguard. They have no AI, so they never sleep, eat, etc. They take over one idle marker and never do anything else. They have all been given the default sandbox 1024 package. (Bug #13024)</li>
<li>When becoming a vampire, the player is supposed to inherit the lightest skin tone for their race, but this was not possible since the settings were identical to the non-vampire skin tone defaults. (Bug #5060)</li>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li><s>The Elemental Fury shout was not working correctly with bows or with dual wielded weapons, and was not applying the speed multiplier correctly for any weapons. (Bug #9249, Bug #9250)</s> [USKP 2.0.2]</li>
<li>The leveled spell entries LSpellWEBattlemageFireLeftHand and LSpellWEBattlemageFireRightHand have the level settings for Fireball and Firebolt backward. (Bug #12203)</li>
<li>Angarvunde could not be marked as cleared because the dungeon lacked a flagged boss actor. A draugr boss has been placed near the word wall and flagged so the dungeon will now clear. (Bug #12432)</li>
<li>AI pack DefaultHoldPositionCurrentLoc256 was incorrectly set to a radius of 128. (Bug #12499)</li>
<li>AI pack KarthwastenSauranachMineSandbox8x12Package had no start time or duration set. (Bug #12486)</li>
<li>AI pack DragonBridgeLumberCamp6x12 incorrectly started at 8am instead of 6am. (Bug #12486)</li>
<li>AI pack KynesgroveRoggeEatDinner19x3 incorrectly started at 9am instead of 7pm which caused a scheduling conflict for Rogge in Kynsegrove. (Bug #12486)</li>
<li>AI pack WindhelmNilsWorkInn14x8 should be starting at 16 instead of 14 to avoid a scheduling conflict. (Bug #12482)</li>
<li>AI pack WindhelmGrimvarSleep22x10 did not have its start time and duration set correctly. (Bug #12482)</li>
<li>AI pack SolitudePalaceLobbySandbox8x12 incorrectly started at 12 instead of 8. (Bug #12480)</li>
<li>AI pack AbeloneEatPackage6x1 was erroneously set to start at 12 when there is already a 12x1 package. (Bug #12478)</li>
<li>AI pack MarkarthAicantarEat20x2Package had no start time or duration, causing it to block the remainder of Aicantar's schedule. (Bug #12478)</li>
<li>Skeletons and Dragon Priests were fighting each other when they mixed because the Dragon Priest faction didn't have SkeletonFaction listed as a friend. (Bug #12519)</li>
<li>The sound from the Elemental Fury shout could become permanently stuck on if the currently equipped weapons failed to accept the enchantment. (Bug #12514, Bug #5058)</li>
<li>Witbane acquired from traps was not set to the correct magnitude to produce the effect of 50% slower magicka regeneration. (Bug #12533)</li>
<li>The blizzard spell's damage value was being augmented by the caster's spell resistance when this should not have been happening. (Bug #10532)</li>
<li>Lightning Storm erroneously had the script to generate ash piles attached to its associated magic effect (ShockDamageMassConcAimed) which would result in generating one pile per kill regardless of whether you had the disintegration perk or not. With the perk, two piles would be spawned. (Bug #9651)</li>
<li>All spells which used the Damage Stamina effect (EnchStaminaDamageFFContact) were enhanced by the Augmented Flames perk due to the effect erroneously having the MagicDamageFire keyword attached. (Bug #12439)</li>
<li>An errant script was attached to the effect used by the Make Ethereal shout (VoiceMakeEthereal) which caused Papyrus errors to be thrown because it had no properties set. (Bug #12186)</li>
<li>The Block Runner and Shield Charge perks were still usable while sneaking due to the lack of a proper check to see if the player is in sneak mode. (Bug #167)</li>
<li>The navmesh inside the Thalmor HQ in Solitude was not fully complete. (Bug #12259)</li>
<li>Fired iron arrows (ArrowIronProjectile) were flagged as "supersonic" which caused them to make out of place sounds when flying past the player. (Bug #12635)</li>
<li>Followers could not join you at Ironbind Overlook due to the lack of a navmesh connection to the door on the upper level of the dungeon.</li>
<li>Lack of preferred pathing outside of Thaumaturgist's Hut in Morthal caused NPCs to take the long way around the building every time instead of the ground level path.</li>
<li>Followers could not join you in jumping from the shortcut path to leave Nchuand-Zel after completing Lost Expedition due to the lack of a navmesh jump connector.</li>
<li>Several merchants were missing the bonus gold from the Master Trader perk despite the perk specifically stating ALL merchants in the world should have it.</li>
<li>Wuuthrad was not inflicting its bonus damage on orcs despite them being Elves who should be affected by it. Perk C06BladeOfYsgramorPerk did not have orc or orc vampires set.</li>
<li>AI Pack MorthalAslfurSleep0x7 Was set to use the editor location for sleeping, which would cause Pactur to return to Stonehills each night to sleep instead of staying in Morthal as expected when he becomes Sorli's steward.</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Kodlak being naked on the floor in Jorrvaskr at the end of Blood's Honor (C04). (Bug #12157)</li>
<li>Bjartur has two lines of idle dialogue to use in the Solitude Jail, but because of an error in setting up the conditions, they would never play. Since her only dialogue is unfitting after the Stormcloaks take Solitude, she will be disabled after the city is taken. (Bug #12501)</li>
<li>Angrenor Once-Honored could not perform his complete AI schedule due to his eat package being blocked by his general sandbox package and because his patrol package had no start time or duration set. (Bug #12482)</li>
<li>Nurelion could not perform his full AI schedule due to his breakfast and dinner packages having no start times or durations. (Bug #12482)</li>
<li>Gularzob could not perform his full AI schedule due to his patrol package blocking due to incorrect time settings. (Bug #12480)</li>
<li>General Tullius never slept due to his castle command package having a bad duration setting. (Bug #12475)</li>
<li>The guards at Sarethi Farm were not linked to their XMarkers and thus would not patrol the area. (Bug #12465)</li>
<li>The guards at Snow-Shod Farm had no patrol route data set up and would thus be standing totally idle all the time. (Bug #12465)</li>
<li>None of the housecarls were able to sandbox throughout the whole house they're assigned to protect. New packages to allow them to do this "in cell" instead of with a defined radius have been generated for them. (Bug #12366)</li>
<li>With Patch 1.9, dunCragslaneLvlBanditGuard was intended to get flagged to respawn. In the process of doing so, his activation name was lost AND his combat style was erroneously set to Dremora instead of 1H warrior. (Bug #12481)</li>
<li>Red Eagle, Warlord Gathrik, and Yngol could all spawn as dragon priests at higher levels. The backstories behind these characters makes this extremely unlikely to have been the case. Plus, in the case of Warlord Gathrik, spawning him as a dragon priest will break the quest at Ironbind Barrow. (Bug #12470)</li>
<li>Drifa uses Pawned Prawn greetings even when she's not manning the store after Bersi dies. (Bug #12027)</li>
<li>The 3 Galdur sons in Reachwater Rock spawn above the ground and then "step" down due to bad linked reference settings. (Bug #12576)</li>
<li>Elgrim's Elixirs never locked up at night because the NPCs there both had sleep packages that weren't set to lock the doors, likely due to Elgrim's AI package bugs which were fixed. (Bug #12579)</li>
<li>Legate Rikke will now assume her more relaxed post-war schedule. Packages CWMapTableSandboxSolitude and CWRikkeSandboxFactionHQ were not conditioned to stop running when Ulfric was dead.</li>
<li>General Tullius will now assume his more relaxed post-war schedule. CWMapTableSandboxSolitude was not set to stop running when Ulfric was dead.</li>
<li>Galmar will now assume his slightly more relaxed post-war schedule. CWGalmarSandboxFactionHQ was not set to stop running when General Tullius was dead.</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The following scrolls were missing the VendorItemScroll keyword: MassParalysisScroll, BaneOfTheUndeadScroll, CandlelightScroll, ConjureFamiliarScroll, CourageScroll, ConjureFlameAtronachScroll, CalmScroll, FastHealingScroll, EbonyFleshScroll, BanishDaedraScroll, ConjureFrostAtronachScroll, ConjureStormAtronachScroll, CommandDaedraScroll, DreadZombieScroll, ExpelDaedraScroll, DeadThrallScroll, ChainLightningScroll, BlizzardScroll, HarmonyScroll, CallToArmsScroll, CircleOfProtectionScroll, GuardianCircleScroll, DragonhideScroll (Bug #12267)</li>
<li>Weapon speed on the Ebony Blade was missed when the adjustments were made to the other two handed swords. (Bug #12497)</li>
<li>Some miscellaneous clutter objects have been given names so they can be picked up. (Bug #12535)</li>
<li>Nord Hero Arrows were set with too high a damage value. Other Nord Hero items are in line with Elven stats, so these arrows now do the same damage as Elven arrows. (Bug #12523)</li>
<li>Imperial swords should be marked as WeapMaterialImperial instead of WeapMaterialSteel. (Bug #12522)</li>
<li>Leveled list LItemWeapon1HIronAndSteelOnly mistakenly contained a light source instead of the expected iron & steel war axes that should have been there. (Bug #12495)</li>
<li>Leveled list LItemWeaponBattleAxe is missing the orcish battleaxes. (Bug #12489)</li>
<li>Frostbite Venom and Lotus Extract lacked the VendorItemPoison keyword and could not be sold to apothecary merchants. (Bug #12556)</li>
<li>Interior load doors for Windhelm's Palace incorrectly generated wood sound instead of metal sound. (Bug #10354)</li>
<li>LItemEnchNecklaceResistMagic should not have been configured to randomize its results against all levels due to being used as a reward for Brelyna's Practice. (Bug #12595)</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>During Hail Sithis (DB11) the game was trying to trigger the scene quest for the Katariah soldiers after the Emperor's assassination, which resulted in errors being logged.</li>
<li>Previous fixes for Derkeethus and his quest exposed another bug. He had no alias package to keep him parked in Darkwater Pass before the player went there to rescue him. (Bug #12477)</li>
<li>The Revelers random quest (WERJ06) should properly terminate now when the NPCs load out of memory after the player leaves. (Bug #12338) [NR]</li>
<li>During Arniel's Endeavor (MGRArniel02) the Staff of Tandil is never taken from the player and given to Enthir. (Bug #12256)</li>
<li>In A Return To Your Roots (NN01) the counter that keeps track of Crimson Nirnroots can't stay sync'd up if multiple roots are added to or dropped from inventory. (Bug #12212)</li>
<li>Urag would repeat the lengthy introduction to Shalidor's Insights (MGR21) every time it started because the tracker variable reset every time. (Bug #12189)</li>
<li>Out of Balance (MGR02) is intended to be a repeatable radiant quest but the script to restart it was not set up properly. It will now trigger itself the same way MGR01 does. (Bug #12181)</li>
<li>The unique bandit Hajvarr Iron-Hand and his henchmen should no longer respawn in White River Watch once Hajvarr Iron-Hand is dead. dunWhiteRiverWatchQST was not being terminated properly. (Bug #12158)</li>
<li>During a civil war city battle, a quest takes citizens off the street (CWCitizensFlee). This quest was capable of filling citizen aliases with city Jarls. If it did so, then the Jarl of that city would instantly vanish back to their editor location once the finale scene for that city had completed. Note that if CWCitizensFlee is currently active the fix will not take effect. (Bug #12156)</li>
<li>After the Imperials take Windhelm, Captain Lonely-Gale is supposed to take over as steward but never did because Jorleif is never exiled. This has now been fixed. (Bug #12106)</li>
<li>Thieves Guild fishing and bedlam jobs could pick from cities other than the 5 the guild is concerned with (such as Raven Rock) which then breaks the quests progressions because they're not set up to check anywhere but Skyrim's major hold capitols. (Bug #12197)</li>
<li>Heimskr's tent should not be enabled if the Imperials have jailed him in Whiterun after the battle. (Bug #12130)</li>
<li>Courier deliveries will now identify what they are delivering to you instead of a meaningless "Items added" message. (Bug #12512)</li>
<li>If Drifa is killed prior to the end of A Chance Arrangement (TG00) it will prevent Taking Care of Business (TG01) from starting since her alias is not optional and she was never marked as essential. This is commonly called the Brynjolf "hmm" bug. (Bug #12209)</li>
<li>The fix for Bug #288 missed the narrow condition of fixing Farkas' outfit property changes if C01 wasn't started yet. (Bug #12211)</li>
<li>Maramal's scene in the Bee and Barb where he chastises the patrons for their sinful ways would not start under some conditions due to the aliases needing to be marked to allow reservations. (Bug #12139)</li>
<li>Sinding could be chosen as a target for Rescue Mission (CR08) because he was not added to the exclusion faction for that quest. (Bug #6510)</li>
<li>In Ill Met By Moonlight (DA05) the version of Sinding in the Falkreath Jail is never disabled after reaching Bloated Man's Grotto. (Bug #6510)</li>
<li>Ill Met By Moonlight (DA05) never stops once the quest is complete.</li>
<li>Due to incorrect conditions, the steward in Windhelm could prematurely tell you there are no more improvements to make to Hjerim even if the killer's mess is still present.</li>
<li>In Blood on the Ice (MS11 - By the Nine Divines! Make it stop!) it was possible for the house to be purchased before the investigation was complete, which then led to the possibility that the basic decorations would get reenabled if you had chosen to buy the bedroom decorations before the quest was over. (Bug #12078)</li>
<li>The mage paraphernalia and Stormcloak corpses that are initially found at Fort Amol were not being disabled once the fort was cleared. (Bug #12159)</li>
<li>During Animal Extermination, the AI pack used to keep the victim outside their home (CR01VictimsMillAboutOutsidePackage) should stop functioning once the beast is killed. The quest should also not be allowed to pick NPCs who have gone on to become Jarl in their city. (Bug #8813)</li>
<li>It was possible for the courier to fail to appear after completing Innocence Lost (DB01) due to the Dark Brotherhood tracking quest losing its update registration. (Bug #12230)</li>
<li>Followers and/or animal companions will become stuck inside Kilkreath Ruins after completing Break of Dawn (DA09). (Bug #408)</li>
<li>When talking to Meridia at the end of Break of Dawn (DA09) the player could begin falling to the ground and die before the timer could run out. This may have been due to the stage 500 fragment disabling the platform before the function that actually runs the fall had started. (Bug #259)</li>
<li>Infiltration (dunTrevasWatchQST) does not mark its objectives as completed as the quest progresses. (Bug #12199) [NR]</li>
<li>Red Eagle's Sword quest (dunRebelsCairnQST) could be restarted simply by revisiting either Rebel's Cairn or Red Eagle Redoubt, and it would be reset to stage 0 REGARDLESS of where in the quest you are, or whether you'd finished it already or not. With no way to know if the currently running quest is legitimate or a restart, this cannot be fixed retroactively. We can only prevent it from triggering any further restarts. (Bug #12059) [NR]</li>
<li>The Lost Expedition (dunNchuandZelQst) does not stop running once completed.</li>
<li>In Discerning the Transmundane (DA04), Septimus sometimes fails to turn into an ash pile upon reading the book. This appears to have been due to an improperly used RegisterForAnimationEvent that was referencing him as an Object instead of an Actor. (Bug #397)</li>
<li>Jaree-Ra continues to suggest seeing him when the player is bored even after Lights Out (MS07) has been accepted. (Bug #12622)</li>
<li>A bad dialogue condition on the "How do I join the Imperial Legion" topic prevented the guards in Solitude from speaking the lines. (Bug #12633)</li>
<li>If the player managed to speak to Brynjolf before encountering Maul, the objective to speak to Brynjolf would become stuck in the journal permanently.</li>
<li>If the player picks up Reyda's necklace prematurely during The Straw That Broke (FreeformIvarstead02) the quest would not advance after speaking to either Narfi or Wilhelm about Reyda.</li>
<li>In Spread the Love (FreeformRiften05) From-Deepest-Fathoms is prompted as though she were male.</li>
<li>In the random encounter with a Namira cultist (WEJS11), Sigar will always address you as though you completed The Taste of Death (DA11) in favor of the cannibals.</li>
<li>During Recipe For Disaster (DB08) it was possible to exploit a dialogue bug when talking to Anton that would result in infinite speech bonuses for intimidation.</li>
<li>While on The Raid (FreeformRiften20) you would be flagged as trespassing in the Riften Warehouse even though the Jarl gave you the key.</li>
<li>Completing the civil war on the Stormcloak side does not close out any dangling objectives in the CWObj quest.</li>
<li>Several dialogue greetings that no longer make sense once the civil war is over have been conditioned to stop playing once it is.</li>
<li>dunAngarvundeQST never stops when completed.</li>
<li>The two main Civil War quests (CW and CWObj) will now be terminated once the war is completely over.</li>
<li>The quest in Southfringe Sanctum did not update the Side Quests achievements count due to the achievement quest property being unset. (Bug #13757)</li>
</ul>

<b>Mesh and Texture Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The Whiterun pool mesh next to the Talos shrine was casting an incomplete shadow. (Architecture\WhiteRun\WRTerrain\WRPondStairs01.nif) (Bug #12506)</li>
<li>Imperial long and medium banners were causing z-fighting and also had the ropes only visible on one side. (architecture\solitude\clutter\sbannerlong01.nif, architecture\solitude\clutter\sbannerlmid01.nif) (Bug #12215, Bug #12400)</li>
<li>Interior non-load doors for Windhelm's Palace generated no sounds when being opened. (architecture\windhelm\doors\whintmetalarchdoor.nif) (Bug #10354)</li>
<li>Honeycomb ingredients have an unnaturally bright glow. (critters\bee\beehoneycomb.nif) (Bug #12447)</li>
<li>Several draugr bodies used as containers were spraying blood when struck with weapons despite obviously being incapable of bleeding. (clutter\bodies\draugrbodylaying01.nif, clutter\ruins\ruinsdeaddraugrsit.nif, clutter\ruins\ruinsdeaddraugr01.nif, clutter\ruins\ruinsdeaddraugr02.nif, clutter\ruins\ruinsdeaddraugr03.nif, clutter\ruins\ruinsdeaddraugr04.nif, clutter\ruins\ruinsdeaddraugr05.nif, clutter\ruins\ruinsdeaddraugr06.nif) (Bug #12586)</li>
<li>The main support columns on the Dragonsreach porch don't quite reach the ground, resulting in a seethrough gap. (architecture\whiterun\WRInteriors\WRCastle\wrintdragonroomrib01.nif) (Bug #12532)</li>
<li>A hairline gap existed for one of the Solitude stairway pieces even when aligned properly. (architecture\solitude\interiors\slgfstasol01.nif) (Bug #12468)</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>More noisy scripts have had their debug messages turned off.</li>
<li>The TurnToAsh() function in ReanimateAshPile was erroneously set to return bool when the function has no return values. (Bug #12246)</li>
<li>MQ104 Stage 65 fragment is erroneously trying to complete Objective 10 when no such objective exists.</li>
<li>TrapExplosiveGas does not perform NONE checks on the trapGasWeapon and flExplodesGasTrapOnHit properties, resulting in numerous Papyrus errors.</li>
<li>DB10 Stage 10 fragment attempts to enable a reference that was enabled by a parent marker in Stage 1, resulting in a Papyrus error.</li>
<li>DB10 Stage 60 fragment attempted to enable an object reference using a call to an actor reference instead, resulting in a Papyrus error.</li>
<li>RemovableTorchSconce01SCRIPT had incomplete logic to deal with placing a torch, leaving the cell, and returning later to have the light source enable. It also had no handling for situations where the torch should have been deleted instead of merely disabled, which could lead to minor save game bloating. (Bug #12070)</li>
<li>dunNchuandZelBookComplete had severely flawed logic that would result in duplicating the books when they were activated and then picked up by the player. It needed to be rewritten using an OnContainerChanged event in order to resolve the problem. (Bug #8398)</li>
</ul>

<b>Text Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fired Nord Hero Arrows were being marked as "ArrowNordHeroProjectile" instead of "Nord Hero Arrow".</li>
<li>Spell RaceArgonianWaterbreathing: "breath" -> "breathe"</li>
<li>Book2ReligiousAncestorsandtheDunmer: "necessary" -> "necessarily" (grammar mistake) (Bug #12517)</li>
<li>The load screen for the Lady Stone implies its effect lasts "for a while" when it isn't. "for a while" has been removed from the description. (Bug #12464)</li>
<li>Text for Absorb Magicka (000aa156) is mistakenly labeled as Drain Magicka. (Bug #12430)</li>
<li>Topic WERoad09Offer: "No Thanks" -> "No, thanks."</li>
<li>dunNchuandZelQst stage 100 log: "more then capable" -> "more than capable"</li>
<li>RecipeResistFire1 incorrectly lists frost salts instead of fire salts as an ingredient. (Bug #12596)</li>
<li>RecipeResistFrost2 incorrectly lists fire salts and a gourd as ingredients. This should be frost salts for certain, and we've arbitrarily chosen silverside perch for the other. (Bug #12596)</li>
<li>EnchRobesRestorationBase: "Magica" -> "Magicka"</li>
<li>RaceArgonianResistDisease: Missing accenting on the number.</li>
<li>SPEL RaceDarkElf (000AA021), SPEL RaceRedguard (000AA023), SPEL RaceWoodElf (000AA025): Incorrect formatting on the accent for the number.</li>
<li>Cell RobbersCove01: "Robbers' Cove" -> "Robber's Cove"</li>
<li>Several potion descriptions were using inconsistent language to describe them in the UI. (Bug #14463)</li>
</ul>

<b>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>In a section of Karthspire not far from the Akaviri puzzle pillars, there are two large gaps between the floor and rock walls. These gaps are just large enough for NPCs to get wedged into with no way to get back out. A pair of wooden planks have been placed to cover the holes so this won't happen. The navmesh in this part of the dungeon was also badly constructed and has been fixed. (Bug #12188)</li>
<li>Grave Concoctions in Falkreath was not flagged with keywords to mark it as a dwelling or a store despite it being both. (Bug #12551)</li>
<li><s>Movarth's Lair could not be marked as cleared because the two vampire boss references were not marked with the proper location type keyword. (Bug #12526)</s> [USSEP 4.3.4]</li>

<li>The cultists' bodies will no longer persist after you arrive in Raven Rock and have found out about Miraak. (Bug #11926)</li>
<li>Deathbrand (DLC2dunHaknirTreasureQST) gets fouled and cannot be properly completed if you break into Gyldenhul Barrow by picking the lock and have the Wax Key perk. The front door to the barrow is now marked as key required, which will prevent this from happening. If you have already proceeded to killing Haknir Deathbrand, this quest can no longer be completed. A retroactive fix is NOT POSSIBLE due to the quest being flagged as "run once" which is a setting that bakes into the save game. (Bug #11965) [NR]</li>

<b>Mesh and Texture Fixes</b>

<li>Onmund could not be dismissed as a follower due to his INFO record script not being properly recompiled after it was fixed. (Bug #12073)</li>

<li>DLC2SV02LvlThalmorMelee1HAggro1024 and DLC2SV02LvlThalmorMissileAggro1024 were respawning due to inheriting respawn flags from their nested templates. If they have respawned already, you will need to kill them again. (Bug #12051)</li>

<li>Ash piles left behind by ash spawns, as well as seeker remains, never clear out when cells respawn. The script which handles this for portions of the USKP has been applied to these objects so they will clear out and thus not contribute to save bloating. (Bug #12026)</li>
<li>The Nordic Heavy Cuirass was not functional on the weight slider. Addon DLC2NordicHeavyCuirassAA has been adjusted via TES5Edit to turn on the invisible value that makes this work. This value is not accessible in the CK. (Bug #11917)</li>
<li>Miraak's Gloves have the wrong keywords - they should be flagged as ArmorClothing and ClothingHands instead of as light armor. This matches them to the other two pieces in the set. (Bug #12214)</li>
</ul>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>AI pack FalkreathDeadMansDrinkSandbox19x6 has the wrong start time and duration set, which causes NPCs using this to sandbox inside the inn all day instead of their normal schedules. (Bug #12111)</li>
<li>AI packs StonehillsTeebaEiSandboxMine6x12 and StonehillsJesperSandboxMine6x12 had impossibly small sandbox radii of 50. They have been raised to 2048 to allow the NPCs to use them to mine properly. (Bug #10581)</li>
<li>AI pack StonehillsTeebaEiSandboxOutside21x4 targets Teeba Ei's editor location inside the mine, which isn't outside where it belongs.</li>
<li>Belethor and Ysolda could become unable to sell goods in the shop due to some invisible faction data that was conflicting with their services faction data. WhiterunBelethorsGoodsFaction and WhiterunBanneredMareFaction were both referencing the shop and its chest when they shouldn't be. This data has been removed via TES5Edit since it is not visible in the CK. The workaround introduced in USKP 1.3.0 has been removed as it is no longer necessary. (Bug #9794)</li>
<li>dunIronbindBarrowBeemJaOutfit gives Beem-Ja a circlet which can cause him to unequip his robes and then proceed into the dungeon naked. The leveled circlet of destruction has been replaced with a leveled ring of destruction so that he will keep his robes on. (Bug #10305)</li>

<li>The AI packs used by Thorald and the other prisoners in Northwatch Keep will no longer use corpse event behavior. (Bug #12011)</li>
<li>Decapitations with the devastating blow perk should not be taking place with blunt weapons. It should now only happen with battle axes and greatswords, as would be expected. (Bug #91)</li>
<li>Enchantment MQ203WeaponDragonDamage3 had an incorrect magnitude that was out of line with the progression of the other 4 in the series. (Bug #10178)</li>
<li>The Patch 1.9 fix for Ancient Knowledge is still wrong. The perk was providing the bonus to all armor EXCEPT Dwemer, which is directly opposite of what the description of it says. It was also multiplying "Tempering Health" by 1.15 rather than raising Smithing skill use by 15% as described. Since Bethesda generated a new perk entry for it, our fix now acts on their provided entry instead of one we created to fix this.</li>
<li>Investing in the Fletcher's shop in Solitude was useless because his merchant chest did not have the proper leveled list item to enable the perk.</li>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>

<li>Galmar Stone-Fist could not execute his sleep package due to it being below his consultation package that has no duration, and because it wanted him to sleep near his editor location downstairs which has no beds. He has been given the bed upstairs that was already marked for the field commander's position. (Bug #12108)</li>
<li>Gloth has no key to the Pelagius Farmhouse and thus cannot exit the building to perform his AI schedule until the player unlocks the door for him. (Bug #12093)</li>
<li>The mage ghosts in Halldir's Cairn were using the wrong voice type. They should be using MaleUniqueGhost (or the female equivalent) but were instead using generic Nord voices due to bad template inheritance. (Bug #12074)</li>
<li>Potent versions of the elemental thralls you get with the Elemental Potency perk were not correctly labeled as potent thralls. (Bug #9809)</li>

<li>The unique Silver Hand "Krev the Skinner" respawns in Gallows Rock due to the alias in "The Silver Hand" (C03) not clearing once he's dead and the quest shuts down. (Bug #6671) [NR]</li>
<li>The quest to rescue Derkeethus from Darkwater Pass (DarkwaterCrossingDerkeethusRescueQuest) could not be initiated by speaking to the miners at Darkwater Crossing due to broken dialogue conditions. (Bug #10616)</li>
<li>The stage 10 journal entry for DarkwaterCrossingDerkeethusRescueQuest mentioned being kidnapped by Falmer, but Sondas never says anything about this when talking to the player. It has been amended to reflect the actual dialogue.</li>
<li>The AI package controlling when Derkeethus forcegreets to complete the rescue might not trigger due to not making sure he was out of Darkwater Pass first. (Bug #12066)</li>
<li>Selling the Elder Scroll to Urag is supposed to enable a display case version of it once you've left the college. This event was broken due to a bad event node flag and has been corrected. (Bug #12182)</li>
<li>Managing to speak to Jarl Igmund before triggering Faleen's forced greeting would still result in Faleen running the forced greeting as though you'd never spoken to the Jarl. (Bug #69)</li>
<li>Affairs of Hagravens (dunBlindCliffQST) will now terminate itself upon completing it inside the dungeon. It will also no longer restart itself incorrectly if you skip ahead and kill Petra before letting Melka out of the cage. (Bug #294)</li>
<li>In Rescue From Fort Kastav (or For Neugard) (CWMission04) the prisoners you are sent to rescue will ignore your order if you tell them to wait. This was due to the script that handles them equipping their gear overriding the follow state variable that controls whether they're waiting or following. (Bug #1096)</li>
<li>The Wolf Queen Awakened (MS06) has been converted into a Change Location event to allow it to execute even if the player has reached level 81 and would then have been unable to make it start. (Bug #254)</li>
<li>Eisa Blackthorn would not usually get accosted by the bandits at Frostmere Crypt because the location data required to start the quest was too narrowly defined. (Bug #1108)</li>
<li>Workaround: Patch 1.7 broke the functionality of the "Say Once" dialogue flag. This has allowed the Thieves Guild special jobs to be turned in more than once because Delvin's dialogue is set up to flag each one this way. Additional conditions have been added to the 4 dialogue options to prevent them from showing up a second time. (Bug #8995)</li>
<li>Due to an unused alias AI package in DialogueWhiterun, the housecarl for the city (Irileth or Olfina Gray-Mane) will remain rooted to a static position next to the throne all the time. This unused package has been removed, along with fixing the order of the guard packages further down. (Bug #1095/Bug #12207)</li>
<li>It should no longer be possible to get the objective to speak to Nelacar in The Black Star (DA01) after you've already spoken to him and started the quest. (Bug #10671)</li>
<li>The quest in Angarvunde can be disrupted by pickpocketing the key from Medresi Dran. The key will now be initialized somewhere other than on her person so it can't be pickpocketed. (Bug #11924) [NR]</li>
<li>During Elder Knowledge (MQ205) the objectives can become jumbled in the journal due to one of the optional objectives being mistakenly marked to "OR" with a previous entry. (Bug #11975)</li>
<li>Items for Thieves Guild fishing quests were not being properly removed from the player at the end of each quest. (Bug #12114)</li>
<li>Fishing Job (TGRGF) quests could select Varnius Junius as a mark in Solitude even though he lives in Dragon Bridge since his editor location is in the Blue Palace. He has now been added to the no pickpocket faction to exempt him from this. (Bug #12177)</li>
<li>Proventus Avenicci could not sell upgrades to Breezehome from the Dragonsreach porch due to bad location conditions on the dialogue records controlling the upgrades. (Bug #12237)</li>
<li>Due to a schedule conflict in the Housecarl alias for DialogueMorthal, the housecarl for the city will not visit the inn as expected and will instead be following the Jarl around. (Bug #12213)</li>
<li>When talking to Maul, he'll tell you that his brother, Dirge, works for the Thieves Guild. This was supposed to let you tell Dirge you'd met Maul but the property on the dialogue record that sets the variable for this was never set. [NR]</li>
<li>After completing the Restoration Ritual Spell (MGRitual04) Colette is supposed to start selling the Guardian Circle spell book. This was not working due to a quest script property being set to the wrong global variable.</li>
<li>The Imperial Luck perk was erroneously being activated for all races when Before the Storm (MQ102) initialized. [NR - No solid means of guaranteeing Imperial players aren't currently werewolves]</li>
<li>Getting turned into a vampire was not curing the player of Ataxia or any of the trap induced versions of all of the diseases. (Bug #12352)</li>
<li>It was not possible to invest in Revyn Sadri's shop due to the dialogue checking for Belethor's investment variable instead.</li>
<li>It was possible for dead people to be moved to the wedding scene for Bound Until Death (DB05) who would have nothing but their underwear on.</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>TrapDweThresher.psc had a potential for creating an infinite loop due to the script not checking properly for the object's 3D being loaded. (Bug #12098)</li>
<li>CritterSpawn.psc was missing an expected boolean return in the SpawnCritter() function. This may have been leading to significant save bloat and appears to have been the major cause of errors in the logs for the various critter generators. (Bug #12101)</li>
<li>PlayerVampireQuestScript does not correctly handle the player being in combat when their vampirism stage should change, causing it to get bumped for another 12 game hours and mess up some of the feed tracking. (Bug #1089)</li>
<li>critterBird function landAtPerch() and flyToPerch() were improperly specifying boolean returns when these functions return no values at all. (Bug #12247)</li>
<li>dunBluePalaceArenaSCRIPT was missing a return in getHealthPerc() (Bug #12248)</li>
</ul>

<b>NIF Mesh and Texture Fixes</b>

<li>The terrible low quality water at blacksmith forges has been improved. It can't be animated, but this water looks much better than the vanilla version. The mesh has also been greatly optimized with several other defects fixed as well. (furniture\blacksmithforgemarker.nif) (Bug #59)</li>
<li>UV errors have been corrected on the Skyforge, as well as several other defects removed and the mesh greatly optimized. (furniture\blacksmithingskyforgemarker.nif) (Bug #12117)</li>

<li>The blacksmith's forge in Whiterun (Furniture\blacksmithforgemarkerwr.nif) has some corrupt black triangles, and the forging blanks show up as all black. (Bug #12118)</li>
<li>Female merchant clothing did not correctly contain a calf partition and thus would clip with a number of other outfits when it shouldn't have. (clothes\merchantclothes\torsof_0.nif, clothes\merchantclothes\torsof_1.nif) (Bug #12099)</li>
<li>157 meshes which have been designated as having LOD and also have static decals applied have been fixed to address issues with the static decals "popping in" at absurdly short distances after the cells have already loaded into memory. (Bug #12094)</li>
<li>Havok material was not set on some Nordic ruin pieces, resulting in no sound made when interacting with them. (norhavokdebris01.nif, norrubblepiece01.nif, norrubblepiece02.nif, norrubblepiece03.nif, norrubblepiece04.nif, norrubblepiece05.nif) (Bug #12052)</li>
<li>Several meshes were lacking double sided texture settings, mostly on animals, but on some plants too, which would cause them to appear with less fur than their textures were created to display. (Bug #12047)</li>
<li>The female fine boots are back for yet another fix to yet another problem with them which stemmed from there being a bunch of stuff not configured right in armor-addons and other things. (Bug #11949)</li>
<li>The Windhelm Stone Quarter mega-mesh has several problems with gaps, UV errors, and ugly tiling. (Architecture\Windhelm\whstonequarter.nif) (Bug #11893)</li>

<li>Four effects can end up randomly applied to the player (AbFXDwarvenCenturion, AbFXDraugrEyes, AbFXIceWraith, AbFXDraugrMagic) which cause anomalies like the player having glowing blue draugr eyes or spewing centurion steam. The conditions on these effects have now been keyword limited so the player cannot acquire them. (Bug #10600)</li>
<li><s>In some cases, Belethor (or Ysolda if he's dead) will not be able to sell to the player. The cause for this is currently unknown, but a workaround has been crafted that should sidestep the bug for their shop in Whiterun. (Bug #9794)</s> [USKP 1.3.1 - Workaround removed]</li>
<li>The right handed version of the lightning bolt spell was erroneously set to use the left hand. (Bug #11886)</li>

<li>The persuade option for getting past the guard at Riften's north gate was incorrectly checking the guard instead of the player for the speechcraft skill.</li>
<li>During Discerning the Transmundane (DA04) harvesting vampires won't advance the objectives. (Bug #11882)</li>
<li>After Varnius makes his plea to Elesif for help in Dragon Bridge, an objective is supposed to be displayed to ask Falk Firebeard about Wolfskull Cave. This never happens because the script in MS06Start is trying to set the wrong objective number.</li>
<li>Previous modifications to the carriage script to solve encumbrance problems have been refined to use more correct code logic. (Bug #11951)</li>
<li>Several of the carriage system destination choices have bad conditions that could result in allowing travel loops (ie: Riften to Riften) and some are also missing appropriate goodbye flags where needed. (Bug #11916)</li>
<li>Several elements of Hadvar's scene inside Alvor's house are prone to breaking down and causing the overall scene to fail, which can then in turn impact the progress of the main quest. (Bug #11914)</li>
<li>Ysolda will still ask Olfina if she works in the inn even if they're IN the inn while Olfina is working. (Bug #9959)</li>
<li>Carlotta and her daughter have a conversation about getting to eat at the inn even if they're already inside. (Bug #9959)</li>

<li><s>If Helm of Winterhold (Favor158) has started, Purity of Revenge (C05) could not start after Blood's Honor (C04) due to the location alias being reserved. The location alias for Driftshade Refuge has now been marked to "allow reserved" and "allow cleared" which enables Purity of Revenge to begin. (Bug #8200)</s> [Official Patch 1.9]</li>
<li>If Driftshade Sanctuary has been cleared before Blood's Honor (C04) is complete and it hasn't reset yet, the location will be forced to do so before starting Purity of Revenge (C05) in order to avoid a bug where C05 would not start.</li>
<li>Blood's Honor (C04) will not start if a conflicting radiant quest is already active in the location. This has been corrected by setting the location alias to allow reserved.</li>

<li>DLC1_WESC09TaronGuard01 is supposed to be a templated actor, but the template assignment was missing. It has been reset to LvlBanditMelee1H based on inventory settings. (Bug #9986)</li>
<li>Fura Bloodmouth should be equipped with a 2H weapon to reflect her status as a 2H weapons trainer, as well as her skill set favoring the same. (Bug #9759)</li>

<p class="h">UDBP v1.0.0 - (2013-02-05)</p>
<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Dragonborn.esm wiped out the body part changes in Update.esm that shipped with official patch 1.8 that made dragon riding possible. These have been restored. (Bug #11916)</li>
<li>Copied 3 cell entries that Dragonborn added location data for on the pathway to High Hrothgar that were overwritten by the USKP.</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The USKP made some corrections to the battle taunts which Dragonborn has changed. These changes have been merged.</li>
<li>The USKP made corrections to two of the trainer topics that were missing properties in their scripts. Dragonborn added a new trainer to these records. The changes have been merged.</li>
<li>The USKP added missing Throat of the World checks to WICastMagic04. Dragonborn added an exemption for Solstheim. These changes have been merged.</li>
<li>Due to a botched INFO form assignment, Dragonborn makes it impossible to dismiss Onmund as a follower.</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Unknown changes have been made to DragonActorScript.psc. The USKP removed debug statements from this, which is causing the result to be overridden. Until CK scripts for Dragonborn are released, the compiled copy from Dragonborn will be supplied with the UDBP. (Bug #11915)</li>
<li>Unknown changes have been made to DA04QuestScript.psc. The USKP and UDGP both alter this script to fix being unable to complete the harvesting objectives for Elven vampires. Until it can be determined otherwise, the changes in DB will be considered a higher priority and its compiled version of this script has been included.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">USKP v1.2.7 - (2013-01-18)</p>
<b>USKP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Changed the dead body container used by the USKP to clean up corpses that have no assigned grave so they will use the vanilla container designated for this purpose and thus propagating this fix to other mods that change the same NPCs will be possible without requiring the USKP as a master.</li>
<li>A new version tracking system is in use now to ensure that retroactive scripts are run in sequence in case future retro-scripts need to rely on anything done in a previous one.</li>
<li>The changes to Flame, Frost, and Shock Cloaks originally added by USKP 1.0 have been reverted since the vanilla implementations of these was actually correct.</li>
<li>The previous fixes for the Caravans quest ended up causing the caravans to stall at their last location unless a new game was started. This has now been corrected. (Bug #9351)</li>
<li>Babette had a set of facegen files that should have been removed during one of the prior fixes for vampire facegen data. (Bug #10253)</li>
<li>Heimskr's preaching scene after moving into the jail has been corrected so he won't wander out unintentionally.</li>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Locked containers that are not animated will not open when picked, requiring a second activation to open them. In the vanilla game, the only 3 container base objects affected are TreasFalmerChestEMPTY, TreasFalmerChest, and TreasFalmerChestBoss. The two meshes used by these 3 objects also needed a dummy animation added on (falmercontainer.nif, falmercontainer02.nif). (Bug #9714)</li>
<li>Leveled list SubCharBandit02Melee2HBerserk was mistakenly populated with Bandit01 NPCs instead of Bandit02 NPCs. (Bug #9330)</li>
<li>Leveled list SubCharBandit01Missile incorrectly contained an entry for EncBandit01Melee1HRedguardM that should have been EncBandit01MissileRedguardM. (Bug #9276)</li>
<li>AI pack WhiterunDanicaSleep24x8 has been changed to a sleep in cell package due to the original condition having too small of a radius. (Bug #9201)</li>
<li>AI pack RiftenDrifaSleep0x6 had too small of a radius on it which would cause Drifa to fail to sleep. (Bug #9201)</li>
<li>AI pack EmbrySleep0x7 had too small of a radius on it which would cause Embry to fail to sleep. (Bug #9201)</li>
<li>AI packs SolitudeSawmillWork0x16 and SolitudeSawmillWork8x16 were both set to the wrong kind of sandbox package, resulting in the sawmill operators just standing around doing nothing. (Bug #9152)</li>
<li>AI pack DA11FINVerulusForcegreetPackage will no longer cause Verulus to repeatedly forcegreet the player if DA11 ends prematurely with Eola's death.</li>
<li>The fixes for the Matching Set perk also needed to be reflected in the PerkMatchingSet spell that actually makes the perk's effects take place.</li>
<li>Enchantment TGNightingaleArmorBoots03 was erroneously set to a magnitude of 35, which instead of making you quieter it made you extremely noisy. The correct value for the progression when compared to the other two enchantment levels should be 0.75. (Bug #9006)</li>
<li>The tempering recipe for the Mask of Clavicus Vile was using steel instead of ebony as expected.</li>
<li>If Yamarz is kept pacified, Cursed Tribe (DA06) will still complete but won't acknowledge he is still alive. Magic effect InfluenceAggDownFFAimedArea has been modified to make Yamarz immune to Pacify and other spells which use this effect. (Bug #266)</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fort garrisons do not properly repopulate after you've taken the first one in the Civil War due to the garrison quest (CWFortObserver) not stopping itself properly after each battle.</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>TES5Edit revealed that an extra script for Louis Letrush that was added by Patch 1.8 had been canceled out. This has been corrected.</li>
<li>Odfel does not carry his unique pickaxe named Rocksplinter even though it exists in the game. (Bug #9649)</li>
<li>Heratar (DA05Hunter13_04Melee_Heratar) has a female voice type assigned but is actually male. (Bug #9592)</li>
<li>Gerdur does not unlock the house when she comes home as would be expected. AI packs GerdurReturnHome16xHalf, GerdurReturnHome15xHalf, GerdurEatHome12x1, GerdurReturnHome11xHalf, GerdurReturnHome10xHalf, GerdurReturnHome9xHalf, and GerdurEatHome19x1 have all been flagged to unlock the doors upon arrival. (Bug #9211)</li>
<li>Kharag gro-Shurkul never sleeps due to his sleep package being blocked entirely by his work package at the sawmill.</li>
<li>Thongvor Silver-Blood will now visit Moth gro-Bagol instead of his sister Ghorza, and only if Moth is not dead.</li>
<li>Thongvor Silver-Blood is now considered to be friends with Moth gro-Bagol rather than his sister Ghorza. This and the preceding change were made because all of the recorded dialogue is between Thongvor and Moth.</li>
<li>Thongvor Silver-Blood will no longer spend his entire time slumped against a wall in Markarth's keep. He will be there from seven in the morning until five in the afternoon, and will otherwise spend his time with the rest of his family in the Treasury (unless he's Jarl, of course). (Bug #9119)</li>
<li>If Elisif cries out in terror while fleeing combat, it will no longer cause all the Blue Palace's guards to become permanently hostile if Boethiah's Calling (DA02) is running. This was related to a section of cut content that no longer applies.</li>
<li>Giraud offers the player a topic to ask if this is the Bards College even when they are not actually inside the building. (Bug #9093)</li>
<li>The two Thalmor soldiers in Understone Keep (MarkarthImperialThalmor) have been modified so their base data does not inherit the respawn flag from their root template. This should allow for them to remain dead when killed after the Stormcloaks take Markarth. If they are alive, they will be killed again and disabled as they should have been. (Bug #8999)</li>
<li>Sorex Vinius had a line of dialogue set to be used inside the Winking Skeever that was inaccessible due to a bad condition. (Bug #8935)</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<b>Text Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Quest MGRArniel03, Objective 16: "warpred" -> "warped"</li>
<li>The 3 abilities received from meditating on a word of power (GreybeardsAbFeim, GreybeardsAbFus, GreybeardsAbYol) do not have the brackets to highlight the numerical value. (Bug #9665)</li>
<li>The Resist Magic (AbResistMagic) effect has no description but is used on a few things. New description added: "Increases Magic Resistance by <mag>%." (Bug #9656)</li>
<li>Loading screen RacialPowersBreton incorrectly describes "Breton Blood" as being 50% magic resistance. It is actually 25%. (Bug #9654)</li>
<li>Book1CheapNineHolds: "the seat of High King" -> "the seat of the High King" (Bug #9256)</li>
<li>WIAddItem07Note: "Letter from Calcemo" -> "Letter from Calcelmo" (Bug #9749)</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">UHFP v1.0.3 - (2013-01-11)</p>
<b>UHFP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>A new version tracking system is in use now to ensure that retroactive scripts are run in sequence in case future retro-scripts need to rely on anything done in a previous one.</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Adopting Sofie should no longer result in her being unable to accept gifts due to having dozens of flower baskets in her inventory.</li>
<li>When asking your steward to buy furnishings for a house, buying the entry hall did not remove the dialogue option despite being processed. The response if it was asked for again would be that you couldn't afford it even though it has already been paid for. This was due to that response having bad condition checks that didn't account for both ways an entry hall can exist. (Bug #6784)</li>
<li>If you relent when ordering a child to go to bed, sometimes female players would hear "Thanks, Pa" instead of the proper response due to a bad dialogue condition. (Bug #9640)</li>
<li>It was not possible to receive the charter for Windstad Manor, or for the courier to deliver the initial solicitation letter for the house, because the quest which controls this (BYOHHouseHjaalmarch) was missing several property settings that made these work. (Bug #8009)</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>When Valdimar is assigned as housecarl for Windstad Manor, he never arrives at the house due to having his house sandbox AI package (BYOHHousecarlHjaalmarchSandboxPlayerHouse) pointing to Lakeview Manor. If Lakeview Manor has not yet been purchased, this would result in him going to Helgen instead. This also appears to have fixed the inability to hire him as a steward for the property. A 2 for 1 deal.</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The wooden toy swords were making metal sounds when blocking. The sound settings for BYOHWoodenSword have been changed to use the block sounds from bows since they sound like wood. (Bug #6690)</li>
<li>The USKP fix that forced proper sizing data to exist on books was canceling out the additions on 3 of them for the child's bedroom additions. This has now been corrected. (Bug #9576)</li>
<li>A potential source of minor save bloating has been addressed when harvesting Salmon. (Bug #9941)</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Some more scripts with useless debug messages have been silenced.</li>
<li>When hiring a steward, BYOHHouseBuildingScript was not checking to make sure they were your current follower before simply dismissing one. This would result in any follower you DID have getting dismissed instead.</li>
<li>When swapping from the Small House to an entry way for a larger house, BYOHHouseScript did not validate that the array of objects to enable or disable could contain NONE objects, causing the script to abort early.</li>
<li>MannequinActivatorSCRIPT.psc has been overhauled in order to finally fix the duplication glitches AND the tendency for mannequins to eat armor that's given to them.</li>
</ul>

<b>Mesh and Texture Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The Enchanter's Tower exterior mesh (_byoh\architecture\byohhouse\byohbyohwrtowerlext01.nif) had an inverted railing you can see through. (Bug #5465)</li>
</ul>

<b>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the placement of the cooking pot in Proudspire Manor so the player will not clip into the fireplace during the animation.</li>
<li>Several dummy books and triggers in the house libraries on the second floor were pointing to the wrong enable parents which made accessing the correct bookshelves for placement impossible. (Bug #9573)</li>

<p class="h">UDGP v1.1.4 - (2013-01-11)</p>
<b>UDGP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>A new version tracking system is in use now to ensure that retroactive scripts are run in sequence in case future retro-scripts need to rely on anything done in a previous one.</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>An official fix in Update.esm made to the VampireSunDamage03 was erroneously canceled out by Dawnguard.esm. This fix has been restored to the original values, as the other 3 versions of this same effect were not reduced in the same manner. (Bug #8983)</li>
<li>It was possible to temper the Aetherial Crown. No other item with a 0 armor rating in the game is able to be tempered, which makes this inconsistent with the system. (Bug #6670)</li>
<li>Durnehviir could be summoned to the Soul Cairn and end up running the same dialogue as though you had summoned him to Tamriel. To prevent this, the Soul Cairn worldspace has been added to formlist OversizedSummoningExceptionWorldSpaces.</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>When starting Hide and Seek (DLC1RH01) the player is never told the objective to speak to Gunmar is complete, even though behind the scenes it actually has been. (Bug #8476)</li>
<li>During Prophet (DLC1VQ03Hunter) the scene where Dexion finishes reading the Elder Scroll has a dialogue which was throwing missing property errors. This may have led to causing Dexion to stand around as though he were reading the scroll even though this event had passed. The property error meant that the command to unequip the scroll would technically fail even if the visual removal seemed to work. [NR]</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>CuSith and Garmr, the Deathhound followers, did not have leveled stats that were in line with dog followers from the rest of the game and were therefore very weak and easily killed.</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>A few more scripts with unnecessary debug info have been silenced.</li>
<li>DLC1EclipseAttackScript.psc does not check to see if the alias slots it is manipulating in GetFarthestAliasFromPlayer() contain NONE objects which can then cause the entire attack script to fail in undefined ways.</li>
<li>In stage 60 of Prophet (DLC1VQ03Hunter) the script fragment attempts to enable and disable two markers which have no assigned properties and for which no actual candidate markers exist. This could potentially disrupt the flow of the quest because the function call aborts. [NR]</li>
<li>DLC1VQ03MothpriestFightScript.psc did not validate the two follower aliases when trying to call them for stopcombat() which would result in an aborted script if the player had no followers. [NR]</li>
<li>DLC1BloodPotionEffectScript.psc did not check for the player being the one to trigger the effect, which enabled any NPC who might drink a blood potion to change the player's feed status.</li>

<p class="h">USKP v1.2.6 - (2012-12-31)</p>
<b>USKP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The USKPRiftenSaerlundSleep0x8 package created for Saerlund was never applied to his NPC record. (Bug #8447)</li>
<li>Retroactive fixes for two Companions radiant quests (CR05 & CR08) which were capable of choosing dead targets have been removed from their original retro-scripts and relocated to the new retro-script for 1.2.6 to be processed properly after discovering that most Companions radiant quests are in a running state as soon as chargen is complete. (Bug #8501)</li>
<li>Reverted the changes to ForswornBootsAA and ForswornGauntletsAA since the armor records for the Old Gods pieces that were the cause of this already have the corrected settings.</li>
<li>Reverted the fix from 1.2.5 that repositioned the cooking pot in Proudspire Manor since it's the same one Hearthfire deletes, which in turn conflicts with the replacement that was done in the UHFP to avoid the risk of a CTD there.</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Hillgrund's Tomb was incorrectly set as being part of The Pale when it should be in Eastmarch. (Bug #8362)</li>
<li>The guardhouse on the east side of Whiterun had incorrect music, incorrect lighting settings, and was marked with an incorrect location setting. (Bug #8325)</li>
<li>AI packages for sawmill workers do not function properly, resulting in the NPCs using them getting stuck where their previous packages ended. (Bug #8485, #851)</li>
<li>When exiting Bleak Falls Barrow through the shortcut out the back, there is no navmesh on the side of the mountain. Followers will therefore not appear with you and may become lost.</li>
<li>The fast travel arrival point in Dragon Bridge has been moved to be closer to where the player's horse would end up. This is consistent with how other locations with horse markers are handled. (Bug #8538)</li>
<li>The Scaled Horn Armor (ArmorScaledCuirassB) was missing a crafting recipe despite other scaled varieties of armor having them. (Bug #8587)</li>
<li><s>The haggling perks deliver inconsistent results. Specifically, Haggling00 only gives 9% on buying when it should be 10%. Haggling20 buy price only gives 13% when it should be 15%. Haggling 40 only gives 17% on buy prices when it should be 20%. Haggling60 only gives 20% on buy prices when it should be 25%. Haggling80 only gives 23% on buying when it should be 30%. All of the selling bonuses on these perks are correct, the buy prices were using incorrect decimal values to produce the expected bonuses. (Bug #8551)</s> [USSEP 4.3.7]</li>
<li>Golden Glow Estate will now be owned by the faction Aringoth and the mercenaries belong to in order to prevent the player from being able to simply take everything there without consequence. (Bug #173)</li>
<li>AI pack MQ103RiverwoodGuard2HoldPosition was sending two guards to meet Irileth in the wrong location, making the scene it belongs to perform awkwardly and sometimes causing the two guards to fail being dispatched to Riverwood. (Bug #916)</li>
<li>The Throw Voice shout was still capable of triggering guards to challenge you about using shouts in cities even though its nature should make that impossible. ThrowVoiceShout has been removed from formlist WICastDragonBornShouts. (Bug #5227)</li>
<li>A faulty road encounter trigger in Falkreath Hold (0010477A) has been corrected. It was missing the RoadStart keyword property necessary for the script to work.</li>
<li>Redbelly Mine, in Shor's Stone, is referred to in dialogue, quests, and in printed game guides for sale IRL as being an iron mine. It is erroneously populated with ebony ore veins and loose ebony ore chunks outside. All of this is being changed to iron in order to reflect the fact that it should be an iron mine. The desiccated bodies are also being removed as dialogue explicitly says there have been no deaths, and indeed nobody has been harmed yet by the spiders. The unspecified spider sacs will remain. The mine will also have modified visuals in an attempt to portray the described "red mist". In order to avoid causing an undue shortage of ebony in the game because of this, Northwind Mine (nearby to the northwest, and is currently an iron mine) will now produce ebony instead. (Bug #1118)</li>
<li>The fast travel marker for Northwind Mine was partially buried in rock, off of the navmesh, which could strand either the player or their followers leaving them unable to move.</li>
<li>Several navmesh vertices in cell -42,1 (MarkarthExterior01) were buried underground making it difficult for NPCs to get around.</li>
<li>The enchantment effect on the Ebony Blade (DA08EbonyBladeTraditionalEnchantment) for absorbing increased health with more kills was missing a progression step between 6 and 10 kills. (Bug #8807)</li>
<li>The CarryAndDropItem AI package template has an error in it that will cause many NPCs using it to fail to execute any packages derived from it. This is due to the travel portion of the template being listed last instead of first. (Bug #1121)</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Adelaisa has packages and factions labeled for being a Candlehearth Hall patron but spends her time at the New Gnisis Cornerclub instead. Fixed AI package targets to bring her back to Candlehearth as intended. (Bug #8349)</li>
<li>Niranye has AI packs to spend time in the New Gnisis Cornerclub but does not have the proper faction to be able to use the furniture. (Bug #8349)</li>
<li>Arivanya has AI packs to spend time at both Candlehearth Hall and the New Gnisis Cornerclub but was never added to the cornerclub faction. (Bug #8349)</li>
<li>Ghorbash and Oglub have a recorded scene, but could never meet to play it due to Oglub being stuck in the mine 24/7. Oglub will now dine in the longhouse at the same time as Ghorbash. (Bug #8284)</li>
<li>Adrianne Avenicci was delivering her shop greetings and goodbyes even when not on duty at the shop or around the forge. These have now been flagged to only run when her forge sandbox package is active. (Bug #8354)</li>
<li>Bendt has a key to Evette San's house even though he has no reason to ever go there. (Bug #8512) [NR]</li>
<li>Further tweaks to Viarmo's AI schedule at the Bards College so that he won't be standing around the lobby doing nothing if the player delays or chooses not to do the quest to retrieve the Edda. (Bug #8466)</li>
<li>Removed the AI pack from Giraud that makes him wait in the lobby for the return of the Edda since he isn't required for this quest to function and it interferes with his ability to run his classroom scenes. (Bug #8466)</li>
<li>Tonilia has been taken out of the JobMiscFaction in order to resolve the issue with her selecting the "What do you have for sale" dialogue option. (Bug #178)</li>
<li>Keeper Carcette and other generic Vigilants of Stendarr will no longer be found carrying Daedric weapons since doing so goes against everything they say and do in the game regarding Daedric objects. (Bug #8820)</li>
<li>Ahtar's AI schedule in Solitude was broken due to the eat package checking for Roggvir's execution still being active and because his jail marker (00074df5) was half buried in a shelf and thus not sitting on the navmesh where it belongs. As a result, he'd be stuck inside his house unable to exit once the execution was over and he went home for the first time. (Bug #1456)</li>
<li>Sibbi Black-Briar would end up sleeping in the wrong bed in the Riften Jail due to a bad target selection in his sleep package. (Bug #12747)</li>
<li>Knjakr's attack radius is too large, causing him to rush the player before they've entered his cell. (Bug #12695)</li>
<li>Sabjorn's AI package after he's jailed in Whiterun had too large a radius, allowing him to sandbox outside the actual jail cell. (Bug #12675)</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>"A Night to Remember" (DA14) cannot start if Ysolda or Ennis are dead. They were not essential NPCs prior to official patch 1.5, but Bethesda did not resurrect them if they had already died. (Bug #8286)</li>
<li>It was not possible to complement Illdi on her flute playing if Inge Six-Fingers was still alive due to a bad condition check on her dialogue. This bad condition check would also block the proper response once Inge was dead, instead running the response as though she were still alive. (Buzgilla #8463)</li>
<li>The rumor quest used to tell the player they should see Viarmo at the Bards College (MS05Rumor) is never stopped once the final objective is completed.</li>
<li>The Companions quest "Dragon Seekers" (CR14) could never be offered because it was listed under a story node requiring Skjor to be alive, but he is dead by the time Glory of the Dead is complete. Glory of the Dead being complete is a requirement for this quest to be offered.</li>
<li>Several NPC aliases in "Tending the Flames" (MS05KingOlafsFestival) are not marked to allow reserved, which greatly cuts down on the number of actors who will attend.</li>
<li>One of the Oculatus agents from Hail Sithis! (DB11) on a ship at the Solitude docks is not disabled when the quest ends. (Bug #8553)</li>
<li>Two of the master spell ritual quests (Illusion, Destruction - MGRitual02, MGRitual01) have conditions set on their initial dialogue branches that should not be there because they block access to the quests unless the skill level is already at or above 100. This is inconsistent with the remaining ritual quests. (Bug #8605)</li>
<li><s>"Dravynea's Frost Salts" (FreeformKynesgroveA) could be repeated, resulting in an exploit which could net you free alteration training without limit. (Bug #6508)</s> [USKP 2.0.1]</li>

<li><s>Asking Ungrien about Maven Black-Briar and using the speech option to persuade or bribe should no longer be repeatable allowing for an unlimited exploit for speech skill. (Bug #111)</s> [Official Patch 1.9]</li>
<li>The Frightened Woman in the above was also marked as a protected alias at some point in a past USKP version to avoid her being killed by random spawns before the player could meet her. (Bug #316)</li>
<li>"To Kill an Empire" (DB09) could not progress if the player used a custom race mod. DB09GiannaPlayerRespondTopic will now drop through to DB09GiannaBusinessTopic (the response where the player tells her enough talking) if the player is not one of the 10 vanilla races or their vampire equivalents. As a by-product of this, the player can also choose this response if they wish to simply avoid listening to her race specific dialogue. (Bug #903)</li>
<li>"Caught Red Handed" (FreeformRiften11) can be triggered silently if the player has pickpocketed one of the Marks of Dibella prior to speaking with Svana. Since this quest is start-game-enabled, separate fixes are required to correct all of this:
 <ul>
  <li>If the player has yet to collect all of the marks, any remaining objectives will now be displayed and the quest will need to be completed as though it were actively taken.</li>
  <li>If the quest has not yet been accepted, the marks will be removed from their NPCs and placed in a chest where they can't be pickpocketed yet.</li>
  <li>Starting a new game, the marks will begin in said chest, and will only be transferred to the NPCs once the quest is accepted.</li>
 </ul>
(Bug #913)</li>
<li>Animal Extermination (CR02) is enabled at game start and its target can be killed, thus making the quest impossible to complete after joining the Companions. It was also possible for the quest to choose a dead target upon being recycled. (Bug #8501)</li>
<li>Bards College scenes where Giraud grills his students (DialogueSolitudeBardScene1) to make sure they're doing their homework would not play correctly due to the event checks looking for Inge and Pantea instead. (Bug #8465)</li>
<li>Delphine and Esbern will now be removed from their starting crime factions into CrimeFactionReach once "A Cornered Rat" (MQ202) is complete and the player has arrived at Sky Haven Temple. (Bug #1116)</li>
<li>During "Blood on the Ice" (MS11 - you cursed bug ridden mess) it is possible to speak to Calixto and cause him to permanently close off his shop, making it difficult or impossible to be able to talk to him about the amulet. The following fixes address this mess:
 <ul>
  <li>Dialogue entries 000e14cc, 000e14f0, and 0003502a have been modified to only run from inside the shop (they're part of his tour package).</li>
  <li>AI pack CalixtoRunsHisShop10x7 has been modified so he will unlock the door. Thus the player doesn't need to risk being caught picking his lock to get in.</li>
  <li>DialogueWindhelmCalixtoTourYes has been set to only be available while inside the shop.</li>
 </ul>
(Bug #6051)</li>
<li>When joining the Stormcloaks, Galmar repeats the last line in his scene with Ulfric discussing Whiterun. This was due to the conditions on the scene phases all checking for <= instead of simply < on the scene phase variable. (Bug #6054)</li>
<li>When watching the Jagged Crown scenes for either side of the war, Galmar/Rikke will repeat their last line of the scene after it is complete. This was due to the conditions on the scene phases all checking for <= instead of simply < on the scene phase variable.</li>
</ul>

<li>Deer hides had an ugly black texture for the rope that ties the bundles together. (Bug #897)</li>
<li>The Staff of Jyrik Gauldurson, and any other staff based on the generic Weapons\Staff01\Staff01.nif mesh, did not cast or receive shadows due to errant alpha map settings. (Bug #249)</li>
<li>The Dwarven Cuirass (Armor\dwarven\dwarvenarmorf_0.nif and Armor\dwarven\dwarvenarmorf_1.nif) had a gap between the wrist and the forearm. (Bug #74)</li>
<li>Bad UV mapping on one of the large tundra landscape pieces (Landscape\Tundra\TundraStreamEnd01.nif). (Bug #258)</li>
<li>The large mesh used as base terrain for part of Whiterun (Architecture\Whiterun\WRTerrain\wrgreymanebase.nif) had several spots of bad UV mapping on it. (Bug #900)</li>
<li>The market stands in Solitude (Architecture\Solitude\Clutter\SMarketStallTop.nif and Architecture\Solitude\Clutter\smarketstall01.nif) will sometimes vanish when viewed at certain angles due to bad alpha mapping properties. (Bugzila #6497)</li>

<p class="h">UHFP v1.0.2 - (2012-12-15)</p>
<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Something as yet unknown scrambled the properties on the HousePurchase quest and made it impossible for the various house door aliases to function after a home had been purchased in a city. The adoption quest property had also somehow been removed, making it impossible for the game to be notified that you had purchased one.</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>BYOHHouseInteriorWorkbenchRoom01A and BYOHHouseInteriorWorkbenchRoom01B were inconsistently labeled as "Workbench" instead of "Carpenter's Workbench" like all of the others.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">UDGP v1.1.3 - (2012-12-15)</p>
<b>UDGP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>A dirty edit on the HousePurchase quest was removed that snuck past being detected.</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>A number of Dawnguard-added magic effects for vampiric absorption spells didn't work on undead, despite the vanilla and player drains working on undead just fine; it would cause problems with Serana, who would blithely use her useless drain spell on hostile undead. Also removed odd check for daedra on the player vampire lord's drainball.</li>
<li>OrcRaceVampire female race data needed its eye type changed to EyesFemaleHumanVampire to deal with more grey face type bugs.</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The bear Gunmar wants you to help him kill in "A New Order" (DLC1HunterBaseIntro) could be missing due to being deleted by the game's cleanup code. (Bug #7941)</li>
<li>During "Destroying the Dawnguard" (DLC1RV10), Florentius is supposed to switch his outfit to his Dawnguard armor but never does.</li>
<li>In "Destroying the Dawnguard" (DLC1RV10) you are told that the Dawnguard is holed up in The Reach. This is incorrect, and there is no appropriate dialogue to substitute so the responses telling you this have been removed. The remainder still makes sense anyway since you've been to Fort Dawnguard before. (Bug #8222)</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Vampires at Castle Volkihar will now drop the proper death items found on all other vampires.</li>
<li>Various radiant quest vampire targets are now properly flagged with the Undead keyword.</li>
<li>Fixed grey faced vampire bugs on the following NPCs: DLC1EncVampire01BretonF, EncVampire00BretonF, EncVampire05BossNordM, EncVampire06BossNordM</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Generic vampire armor enchanted with fortify magicka regen has been added to the leveled list of vampire attire (they were unused; new leveled list based off similar list for warlock and necromancer robes with indentical enchantments)</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a typo in Serana's leveling script that prevented the fifth-tier vampire drain spell from being removed from her (+ Harkon and Valerica too).</li>

<b>Texture Fixes</b>

</ul>

<p class="h">USKP v1.2.5 - (2012-12-15)</p>
<b>USKP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Biped object names have been corrected after a previous version had their values shifted improperly by a bad version of TES5Edit. No harm was done to the game. It only annoyed the CK when loading the file.</li>
<li>The script fix in USKP 1.2 for High Gate Ruins to open the gates if you returned after Vokun was dead did not account for arriving in the location if you were there to kill Vokun. Yeah. That was dumb.</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The book "Songs of Skyrim Revised" contains material only relevant after the main quest is over, but was spawning in leveled lists prior to it actually being done. (Bug #8024)</li>
<li>DaintySloadLocation was not marked as being a ship. Added LocTypeShip keyword. (Bug #7179)</li>
<li>The navmesh in FortSungard05 was hopelessly messed up. It would be a miracle if the NPCs there could have actually used it.</li>
<li>It was possible to become stuck in Irkngthand at the final door from the Slave Pens (Irkngthand03) if the Thieves Guild quest had been completed already. A ramp into the pit where you can become stuck has been added, and the navmesh adjusted to allow followers to behave properly. (Bug #8171)</li>
<li>AI pack SolitudeBardsCollegeClassIngeTeach4x4 had the wrong location marker, causing Inge Six-Fingers to teach class from the wrong room. (Bug #8246)</li>
<li>AI pack BardsCollegeSleepEditorLoc22x8 was set to the wrong hours (20, duration 12) instead of the correct ones (22, duration 8) which would cause disruption in schedules for every NPC using this package. (Bug #8246)</li>
<li>AI pack SolitudePanteaEatLunch10x3 creates schedule conflicts with the other AI packs she uses. It has been set to run at 12pm for 2 hours now since there's a hole in her schedule there. (Bug #8246)</li>
<li>AI pack SolitudeBardsCollegeSandbox will no longer allow sleeping since all of the bards have sleep packages already.</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Something as yet unknown scrambled the properties on the HousePurchase quest and made it impossible for the various house door aliases to function after a home had been purchased in a city.</li>
<li>In "Dragon Hunting" (FreeformSkyHavenTempleB) it was possible to get the objective to return to Esbern before he had sent you out to hunt a dragon. (Bug #7990) [NR]</li>
<li>Related to the above, it was also possible for FreeformSkyHavenTempleB to activate before you had recruited all 3 Blades followers due to a bad condition check on the quest data. [NR]</li>
<li><s>The final scene in the Avanchnzel Boilery does not play out due to the first scene phase incorrectly checking start conditions instead of completion conditions. (Bug #7489)</s> [USKP 2.0.0]</li>
<li>Wedding decorations placed for "Bound Until Death" (DB05) are never cleaned up after the end of the quest. Neither is the Penitus Oculatus guard who appears for the ceremony. (Bug #7300)</li>
<li>Completing the quest in Soljund's Sinkhole (FreeformSoljundsSinkholeA) does not disable the draugr in the mine and can result in the miners being killed when they return to work the area. (Bug #7437)</li>
<li>"Cursed Tribe" (DA06) never disabled the marker that controls the leveled giant and the random orcs outside the gate to Largashbur. Due to bugs in the respawn system, this giant and the orcs could end up respawning and fighting battles even after the quest was over. (Bug #8124)</li>
<li>In "The Straw that Broke" (FreeformIvarstead02) taking Reyda's amulet to Wilhelm would trigger a dialogue that was clearly intended for Narfi to say, but was in fact completely unnecessary since the objective it was intended to set happens when the amulet is picked up. Dialogue topic FFI02NarfiBranchPreTopic has been disabled so it won't be available. (Bug #8016)</li>
<li>Brunwulf Free-Winter has a goodbye dialogue for male PCs, but it was not flagged to only work on male PCs. He was also missing a response entry for female PCs.</li>
<li>One scene between Falk and Bryling (DialogueSolitudeErikurScene3) takes place at the Blue Palace but makes no sense when being run there due to dialogue indicating they should be handling it secretly instead of in front of the entire royal court. Conditions have been changed to prevent it from running when in the Blue Palace.</li>
<li>Giraud's class scenes at the Bards' College (DialogueSolitudeBardsCollegeClassGiraudScene1 and DialogueSolitudeBardsCollegeClassGiraudScene2) could be started even if none of the participants were present.

Their lines would play from wherever they happened to be in the building. (Bug #8246)</li>
<li>Pantea tells her student's she'll demonstrate "The Age of Aggression" but begins singing "The Age of Oppression" instead due to a bad condition on action 4 of the scene (DialogueSolitudeBardsCollegeClassPanteaScene2) (Bug #8246)</li>
<li>The second scene for Giraud's classes (DialogueSolitudeBardsCollegeClassGiraudScene2) was incorrectly set to start the scene from his first one. (Bug #8246)</li>
<li>The second scene for Inge's classes (DialogueSolitudeBardsCollegeClassIngeScene2) was incorrectly set to start the scene from her first one. (Bug #8246)</li>
<li>Major overhaul of the Caravan quest to handle instances where the tents don't show up, caravan members die, leaders need to be replaced, etc, due to the vanilla script being wholly inadequate for the job. New scripts have been applied to the aliases and AI packs to facilitate this. (Bug #181)</li>

<li><s>Ugor has been corrected to level 10-30 to remain consistent with Atub. (Bug #7248)</s> [USSEP 4.2.4]</li>
<li>Garakh was intended to be a blacksmith vendor but there was no faction for this to be possible. His merchant and blacksmith factions ranks were also incorrect. (Bug #7247)</li>
<li>Atub was unable to function as an apothecary vendor due to her faction rankings being set wrong. (Bug #7246)</li>
<li>The Stormcloak guards who occupy Dragon Bridge once Solitude has fallen were not members of the town's guard faction, causing them to drop town specific dialogue they should have.</li>
<li>Addvar was given a key to Karthspire Redoubt's jail instead of the one to his own house. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Addvar#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>Giraud Gemane was not able to teach his class at the Bards' College due to his teaching AI pack being below his default sandbox package. (Bug #8246)</li>
<li>Aia Arria would never sleep due to her sleep package being listed below her default sandbox package. (Bug #8246)</li>
<li>Ataf had no sleep package and would continue whatever his last action was all night until another package took over. (Bug #8246)</li>
<li>Ataf also had a schedule conflict with his flute playing package that would prevent him from attending the 8am class. (Bug #8246)</li>
<li>Illdi was using the BardsCollegeSleepEditorLoc2x8 AI pack but this caused a large conflict in her schedule. She now uses the BardsCollegeSleepEditorLoc22x8 package, which was probably the intention anyway. (Bug #8246)</li>
<li>Pantea Ateia's eat package blocks most of her teaching package and has been switched so that it will no longer interfere. (Bug #8246)</li>
<li>Jorn's AI to play his flute outside was directly conflicting with his class schedule and he was therefore not attending the 8am session. (Bug #8246)</li>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>

<li>Brunwulf Free-Winter lacked an audio file response appropriate for his missing female specific goodbye line. (Bug #5422)</li>

<li>Tumblerbane Gloves (DBArmorGlovesReward) do not display the wrists when worn due to having the forearms flag when the model doesn't use them. (Bug #246)</li>
<li>Armor add-ons FineClothesTorso01AA and FineClothesVariant01AA used by several playable outfits would cause boots to disappear on females in 3rd person. This was due to having a bad priority setting on the female model. (Bug #363)</li>

<p class="h">UDGP v1.1.2 - (2012-11-24)</p>
<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The Drain Vitality shout that dragons use should no longer interfere with the shout the player learns. If you have been affected by the bugged shouts, they will be removed, and the words of Drain Vitality you unlocked previously will be retaught when the update script runs. (Bug #6712) (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/16637">BGS Support #16637</a>)</li>
<li>Dawnguard overrides the Patch 1.8 updates for the new dragon saddle bone. The UDGP restores the updated data so that it will function properly.</li>
<li>Non-archery weapons would become stuck on the right side during mounted combat due to an oversight in the idle animation setup for RightAttackRelease.</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>"Rescue" (DLC1RH06) may get fouled up beyond repair if the player encounters their kidnapped friend or spouse before being made aware of the quest. (Bug #7127)</li>
<li>Discerning the Transmundane (DA04) stage 10 journal entry tells the player they are retrieving the Elder Scroll for Paarthurnax, even though it is possible to pursue this quest in Dawnguard without ever having met Paarthurnax. The journal will no longer mention his name. (Bug #6599)</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>DLC1EncVampire00BretonF was overlooked when setting the vampire eyes and fixing grey face bugs.</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>DLC1WE02Script.psc could end up continuing to update even after the event quest it was tied to had been stopped, leading to a flood in the Papyrus logs and impeding the performance of other scripts. This may also be partly responsible for blocking Gelebor from activating the first wayshrine - this has not yet been confirmed though.</li>
</ul>

<b>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Lowered a cliff rock in cell 44,-15 (0200D1F7) to fix a visible gap behind it. (Bug #5887)</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">USKP v1.2.4 - (2012-11-21)</p>
<b>USKP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Biped slot errors leftover from edits to the Argonian, ArgonianVampire, and OrcVampire race have been corrected for Patch 1.8.</li>
<li>Documentation has been checked for typos and missing entries from old changes have been added.</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Brought two College robe enchantments in line with the others (master Restoration robe was decreasing cost by 25%, master Alteration by 20%, all other robes had 22%).</li>
<li>NPCs who wear random farm clothes will no longer sometimes appear undressed. ClothesFarm removed the ClothesFarmClothes03withExtras outfit from the leveled list.</li>
<li>The Dremora race was not set to use head tracking animations. (Bug #5223)</li>
<li><s>The matching set perk for light armor has been corrected to include the USKP added keywords for the normal Thieves Guild armor as well as the Guildmaster armor set. (Bug #4086)</s> [Official Patch 1.9]</li>
<li>Force Without Effort was missing its menu display icon. (Bug #5315)</li>
<li>Deep Wounds, Bladesman, Critical Shot, and the Vald's Dagger perks will now properly stack and interact with each other as intended. (Bug #7043)</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>MannequinActivatorSCRIPT.psc should no longer allow equipment duplication to occur or for mannequins to wander from their platforms.</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Corrected a rather egregious line Dengeir could utter ("I'll be Jarl again someday!") despite being Jarl already if the Stormcloaks had Falkreath.</li>
<li>Sorli the Builder and Teeba-Ei will no longer speak as though they're in Stonehills when they're in Morthal.</li>
<li>Speaking to Mikael was restarting the "Investigate the Bard's College" quest due to a bad stage check in the dialogue script. (Bug #6720)</li>
<li>The Penitus Oculatus guards in Solitude that are assigned there for DB09 will now be cleaned up when that quest ends. (Bug #6518)</li>
<li>It was possible for "Stealing Plans" (CR10) to create the target object in an inaccessible chest instead of the proper boss container at the assigned dungeon. (Bug #6505)</li>
<li>If Vald is killed before his debt quest can be fulfilled (FreeformValdDebt), the quest will be stopped once the Quill of Gemination is turned in if it is still running.</li>
<li>Related, if Vald is killed before talking to Maven about his debt, FreeformValdDebt will be terminated as failed. If you have talked to Maven, but Vald later dies, you will still be allowed to turn in the Quill but will not receive Vald's debt in return. (Bug #308)</li>
<li>It will no longer be possible to start Vald's Debt quest if he is already dead by the time Brynjolf mentions him. (Bug #343)</li>
<li>Also in "Promises to Keep" if you exit dialogue early when turning Frost over to Louis Letrush, he will no longer run off and leave the horse behind. (Bug #5312)</li>
<li>Blood on the Ice will now allow you to complete the quest after the Imperials have taken over Windhelm. The guard acting as a CSI will switch properly to an Imperial as needed.</li>
<li>Cicero (on the road north of Whiterun) will now be properly disabled once you have concluded the mini quest at the Loreius farm. The DB01Misc quest will also be properly stopped as well.</li>
<li>When the Imperials get control of Whiterun during the Civil War, Heimskr will now be sent to jail as was intended.</li>
<li>If the Imperials take Windhelm while Blood on the Ice (MS11) is running, the guard is never swapped out properly to allow the quest to be completed once the city has changed ownership. (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/16566">BGS Support #16566</a>)</li>
<li>Farengar can no longer be asked if he owes his allegiance to the Imperials if the Stormcloaks have Whiterun (duplicated dialogue and changed the prompt to "Do you owe allegiance to the Stormcloaks?", since his response indicates that he doesn't care who's in charge, but it seems odd to ask about Imperial allegiance if they no longer have the city).</li>
<li>Freir (priestess in Solitude) will no longer discuss the rightness of the White-Gold Concordat and the missing Talos shrine if the Stormcloaks have the city (because she swaps over to saying "Nine Divines" instead of "Eight Divines" in all her other dialogue).</li>
<li>Perfected Kynesgrove backups: Kjeld can now sell innkeeper merchandise and won't give rumors before he's a publican.</li>
<li>When Arivanya is killed by the Butcher, she will show the same type of wounds as Susanna did (such mutilation being apparently indicative of the Butcher's "interesting knifework"; unused outfit).</li>
<li>After completing "Innocence Lost" (DB01) the ritual mess that's still sitting in Aretino's house will be cleaned up properly. (Bug #5947)</li>
<li>Also after completing DB01, Angrenor Once-Honored should take up residence in the house after Aretino has left the city.</li>
<li>Entering High Hrothgar from the back door the first time will not cause the Greybeards to congregate as expected. The trigger has been duplicated and placed at the back doors to correct this. This bug is only possible if you exploited using a horse to climb up the back side of the mountain. (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/16541">BGS Support #16541</a>)</li>
<li>In "The World-Eater's Eyrie" (MQ303) it was possible for the scene between Farengar and Odahviing to play even if Farengar had been killed previously.</li>
<li>The scene where Braith bullies Lars into promising 10 septims will now play out with the dialogue in the proper order. (Bug #5612)</li>
<li>At the end of the master conjuration ritual quest (MGRitual03) the unbound Dremora is never removed from the game after completion. The ritual candles are never cleaned up either, despite Phinis Gestor making a big deal of safety. (Bug #6509)</li>
<li>The encounter with Deep-in-His-Cups (WEDL08) should now only spawn once instead of repeatedly, regardless of how you resolve it.</li>
<li>The follow up quest after Diplomatic Immunity where you help Malborn by killing a Thalmor assassin (MQ201Malborn) will properly acknowledge the death of the assassin and allow the quest to complete. This was fixed once before, but apparently the fix was somehow lost and previous documentation right along with it.</li>
<li>The precursor quest to the Bard's College (MS05Start) is never stopped once the player has agreed to retrieve the book Viarmo wants.</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The war camp generals will now run the dead body cleanup script after 3 days so their corpses aren't in the game forever. [NR]</li>
<li>Cicero's body will now be scheduled for cleanup after killing him in the Dawnstar Sanctuary.</li>
<li>Thonjolf had an extra sleep package which has been removed.</li>
<li>One generic necromancer will no longer have pigtails and squinty eyes (he was using female head parts).</li>
<li>Arniel Gane has been given a custom class so that he can cast the Destruction spells he was given; he will no longer attempt to punch magic anomalies to death during MG05.</li>
<li>The ghostly Arniel Gane one can summon after finishing his questline now actually looks like him.</li>
<li>The Dark Brotherhood initiates, as well as Cicero, will no longer annoy the player by repeating their hello lines over and over when they are following the player.</li>
<li>Re-exported face data for a number of male Altmer to correct their "melty" eyes; if anyone sees another Altmer will similarly-melty eyes, please report it to the bug tracker. (Bug #64)</li>
<li>Varnius Junius will no longer walk back and forth between Dragon Bridge and the Blue Palace.</li>
<li>Ghorbash the Iron Hand was incorrectly classed as a ranger, which focuses on archery, instead of a 1H warrior which his equipment selection strongly supports. (Bug #6165)</li>
<li>Guards in Winterhold did not carry shields.</li>
<li>Guards will no longer have doubled up damage perks which cause them to deliver one shot death blows even to high level players.</li>
<li>Commander Caius wasn't quite intended to be exiled to the Blue Palace -- unused packages (and his dialogue about "this city") indicate him simply being removed from his post but allowed to stay. Removed his CWExile package.</li>
<li>The thralls in Labyrinthian were both male, despite ostensibly being Hafnar and Atmah (so one should be female); they now look like Hafnar and Atmah. Also corrected one of them bleeding (because, you know, they're ghosts) and being a Dragon Priest by class (the Bandit Wizard class, like thrall #1, is more appropriate, since they use only Destruction spells and daggers while the Dragon Priest class focuses on Conjuration and Alteration).</li>
<li>Exported facegen for Estormo to fix his melty eyes.</li>
<li>Vittoria Vici was not performing her merchant duties despite the previous attempt to fix this due to aliases being unable to take new faction settings after a quest is started. (Bug #6904)</li>
<li>Useless keys have been removed from the inventories of the following NPCs: Acolyte Jenssen, Ahlam, Hjorunn, Jesper, Nazeem, Romlyn Dreth, Swanhvir, and Teeba-Ei. (Bug #5587)</li>
<li>Drahff and Hewnon Black-Skeever were missing the dead body cleanup script. [NR] (Bug #5220)</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The jester's hat model for male Argonians was pointing to the model for male Khajiit, causing it to clip through an Argonian male's brows.</li>
<li>Black mage robes now provide +75% magicka regen instead of 50% to match the hooded version.</li>
<li>The FineBoots01AA and FineBoots02AA armor-addons did not cover the calf slots, causing any upper body armors and clothing that do to clip with them.</li>
<li>EnchClothesRobesMageHoodNovice, TemplateClothesRobesMageNoviceHood, and ClothesCollegeHood were all missing proper armor-addon variants for orcs, and the MageApprenticeHoodAA armor-addon was incorrectly being flagged as useable on orcs when MageApprenticeHood_OrcAA exists for this purpose but was not being used. (Bug #6170)</li>
<li>Several books with zero size have been corrected to provide an actual size value. This will help prevent book shelves from throwing books off of them. (Bug #6886)</li>
<li>Ore veins MineOreBlackreach03, MineOreBlackreach03_LMountain, and MineOreBlackreach04 are all incorrectly giving Corundum instead of soul gems. (Bug #6865)</li>
<li>Fixed the Whiterun and Solitude light sources so that they won't dim noticeably on approach. (Bug #289)</li>
<li><s>Standard Thieves Guild armor has been given a unique keyword for the matching set perk so it can no longer be improperly combined with normal leather for the bonus.</s> [Official Patch 1.9]</li>
<li>The poison cloak enchantment on the Ebony Mail will no longer cause unintended damage during brawls. (Bug #427)</li>
<li><s>Sheath and unsheathe sounds for SteelDagger, OrcishDagger, DwarvenDagger, ElvenDagger, EbonyDagger, and DaedricDagger were all incorrectly using the sounds for full sized swords. (Bug #6394)</s> [Official Patch 1.6.1130]</li>
<li>The enchantment for the Staff of Inspiration (StaffEnchRally) did not match the effects given by the Rally spell. (Bug #5122)</li>
<li>The enchantment for the Staff of Courage (StaffEnchCourage) did not match the effects given by the Courage spell. (Bug #5122)</li>
</ul>

<b>Mesh and Texture Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>SLightPost01.NIF (included in an apparently undocumented previous USKP fix) has been corrected to restore the broken alpha channel that had gone missing. (Bug #6816)</li>
<li>The fancy locked door in Volunruud had wrongly sized sockets for the ceremonial weapons used as keys to open it. (Bug #6201)</li>
<li>Cave roots were using a texture that was flat and ill defined. This has been replaced with one that looks better against the darkness in caves. (Bug #3597)</li>
<li>Closed several gaps in the mesh that makes up the stairway area in front of Jorvaskr in Whitetun. (Bug #4269)</li>
<li>The orcish battleaxe nif (orcishbattleaxe.nif) had an animation controller link added to it that was causing it to go haywire when used with weapon racks. (Bug #138)</li>
</ul>

<b>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Changed the ownership of Winterhold's throne so Thaena won't sit on it while Korir is away.</li>
<li>The Forsworn spawns outside of Kolskeggr Mine that should have been disabled with the earlier USKP fix are now also disabled along with the ones inside the mine. (Bug #6521)</li>
<li>Added a prayer idle marker in the Temple of the Divines in front of the Talos shrine to match the other shrines (it's parented on the Shrine, so it can't be used unless the shrine is there).</li>
<li>The large porch at Dragonsreach (0005D2C0) was slightly disconnected from the main castle, when viewed from the wilderness at Battle-Born Farm. (Bug #6851)</li>
<li>The top of one of the towers at Mzinchaleft (00057D04) was sitting too low in its area. (Bug #6884)</li>
<li>A missing section of navmesh has been added to the above tower at Mzinchaleft, enabling the NPC stationed there to use the chair during his AI routine.</li>
<li>Two wall lean markers in Falkreath (000CDE8A, 000CDE9B) were embedded into their posts far enough to snare the NPCs inside. (Bug #6106)</li>
<li>The two door markers leading to Solaf's shop in Falkreath were partially embedded into the doors, which could trap NPCs behind the building mesh.</li>
<li>One of the collision barriers outside of Windhelm (0010FDC1) blocked access to the two iron ore veins there. (Bug #6030)</li>
<li>Misaligned walkway part in cell -13,-25 (0004BDF8) corrected. (Bug #5952)</li>
<li>Mikael and Saadia did not own their proper beds at the Bannered Mare and would sometimes not be able to sleep. (000616D1, 000CA021) (Bug #5945)</li>
<li>Several ice wraith teeth that were floating have been grounded. (000D24E0, 000D24E1, 000D24E2, 000D24E3) (Bug #6237)</li>
<li>Display case clipping with the wall behind it. (000D2494) (Bug #6237)</li>
<li>Elk Antlers (000D24CA) clipping with a display case in Aela's room have been switched with the wall basket (000D24BC) (Bug #6237)</li>
<li>Chest facing the wrong direction. (000D2426) (Bug #6237)</li>
<li>One banner clipping Ulfric's throne (000C10D7) and two banners hanging too far forward (000C10D6, 000C10D5) have been corrected. [NR] (Bug #6237)</li>
<li>A missing banner over one of the doors to the upstairs wing has been added. (Bug #6237)</li>
<li>Floating flowers outside of Sylgja's house. (000B452D) (Bug #5885)</li>
<li>A buried wall section outside Whiterun has been removed. (0007CE3F) (Bug #5238)</li>
<li>The navmesh behind Salvius' farmhouse has been extended to cover areas it should have, due to followers getting stuck trying to tag along there. (Bug #5621)</li>
<li>The cell where the Alik'r Warrior gets sent to during "In My Time of Need" (MS08) could not be unlocked. The door (000A7615) will now open with the Whiterun Jail Key like all the others. (Bug #5583)</li>
<li>Woodcutting axes have been added next to the wood piles in Whiterun, Riften, and Windhelm so that the player being asked to chop wood won't result in needing to exit the city and travel to a nearby village just to get an axe. (Bug #3452)</li>
<li>The Stormcloak guard at Sarethi Farm was not attached to the enable parent, which would cause fights with the Imperial guard if The Rift is under Imperial control. (Bug #6960)</li>
<li>The remaining vanilla wheat stalks which had not already been grounded properly have been corrected.</li>
<li>Several coastal driftwood pieces have been grounded. (00018117, 00018115, 00018116, 00018118, 0001810A, 0001811A) (Bug #7037)</li>

<li>Rock piece (0005BB67) rotated to cover a gap at one end above the ground. (Bug #7038)</li>
<li>Two rocks have been placed underneath a waterfall (00035DCA) in order to conceal a pair of large gaps. (Bug #7036)</li>
<li>Lowered a portion of the cliff (000A7E2D) at Autumnwatch Tower to conceal a gap below it. (Bug #7039)</li>
<li>A gap between glacier pieces in cell -6,36 (000FF435) has been closed by adding a smaller glacier slab to cover it. (Bug #6272)</li>
<li>Rock at Fort Sunguard (00044AAF) lowered slightly to close a ground gap. (Bug #5640)</li>
<li>Rock added to cover a ground gap in cell -18,9 for ID 000C2F96. (Bug #5640)</li>
<li>Rock added to cover a gap in the cliff in cell -12,9 (000A51AF). (Bug #5640)</li>
<li>An orcish chair in the Dushnikh Yal longhouse (00097E5D) has been converted into a usable furniture marker so Murbul can actually sit down to read.</li>

<b>Text Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>"Blade of The Reach" will now be labeled as "Axe of The Reach" since the weapon is taken from the axe lists instead of swords.</li>
<li>Geimund's subtitle: "quick as a wink" -> "quick as you wink" (Bug #6370)</li>
<li>Book4RareSongOfReturnV24: "vol 24" -> "Vol 24" (Bug #6887)</li>

<p class="h">UHFP v1.0.1 - (2012-11-06)</p>
<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The USKP fix for removing the weight restriction on using the carriages has been merged with the UHFP script updates.</li>
<li>Several spammy scripts have had their debug statements commented out to avoid filling the Papyrus logs with garbage.</li>
<li>MannequinActivatorSCRIPT.psc should no longer allow equipment duplication to occur. (Bug #7174)</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Switching the enchanting room in Honeyside for a child's bedroom will no longer cause you to lose any equipment stored on the mannequins. Equipment stored there will now be transferred to the chest near the double bed upstairs. (Bug #7172)</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>FoodPotatoSoup and BYOHFoodClamChowder lacked the VendorItemFood keyword, which was inconsistent with all other food items in the game. (Bug #6848)</li>
</ul>

<b>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The vanilla cooking pot that Hearthfire deleted in Proudspire Manor has been restored.</li>
<li>The carriage horse outside of Heljarchen Hall was shifted out of position. This change will not take effect on an existing save.</li>
<li>The two mannequin stands in Honeyside (00102BE5, 00102BDE) were set to the wrong enable parent in the DLC and would disappear when the enchanting room had been purchased, and would reappear in the event that was swapped to the child's bedroom and thus be clipping with the replacement tables. (Bug #6824)</li>
<li>The double beds where the player and their spouse sleep in Windstad Manor and Heljarchen Hall were not set as owned by the PlayerBedOwnership faction which would deny the Well Rested bonus when used. (Bug #5596)</li>
<li>Location data for Honeyside in Riften was erroneously tagged with LocTypeInn.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">USKP v1.2.3 - (2012-10-23)</p>
<b>USKP Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The quest built to deal with the essential civil war camp soldiers was not configured properly. The script intended to attach to aliases for Tullius and Ulfric was never attached because the aliases had never been created in the proper place. This should now be corrected and this quest will be started again if it's not already running.</li>
<li>Two backup reference alias properties were somehow lost for DialogueFalkreath and DialogueDragonBridge and have been repaired.</li>
<li>Removed the optimization fix for the house door scripts. Seems people will just have to live with them not working since fixing them apparently didn't work any better.</li>
<li>The BSA file is now being compressed due to its growing size. Blame Steam.</li>
<li>The fix for Louis Letrush has been removed. It has now been fixed officially in Patch 1.8.</li>
<li>Generated an SEQ file, which will be maintained as needed for future updates. This file ensures the start-enabled retroactive fix scripts will be processed properly.</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Some more scripts that issue unnecessary debug traces have been silenced.</li>
<li>SoundTrap.psc, TripWire.psc, PhysicsTrap.psc, MagicTrap.psc, and MaceTrap.psc were all incorrectly using OnCellAttach() to handle a function call requiring the object's 3D to be loaded. They instead need to use OnLoad() for this and have been corrected. This may result in a large number of previously dormant trap objects suddenly being more effective.</li>
<li>StockadeBarricade01ActivatorScript.psc did not properly validate whether its linked reference was valid or not before trying to enable it.</li>
<li>After Scoundrel's Folly (TG04) Gulum-Ei is supposed to begin fencing goods but is unable to do so because his chest's enable parent setup is wrong.</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>A faulty road encounter trigger in Falkreath Hold (0008F4AA) has been corrected. It was missing the RoadStart keyword property necessary for the script to work.</li>
<li>Having the Deep Freeze, Intense Flames, or Disintegrate perks will no longer cause your cloak spells to kill followers who are in bleedout.</li>
<li>Necromage no longer boosts the power of spells and enchantments used on a vampire player.</li>
<li>Corrected a bunch of MS06 pre-quest packages with invalid conditions.</li>
<li>Combat music would sometimes not play if the player's armor ratings were too high.</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>"The Lover's Requital" (FreeformRiften02) will no longer fail on Lynly's death (there was dialogue where Sibbi thanked the player for killing her, but the quest always failed and stopped on her death thanks to the defaultsetstagealias script attached to her alias)</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Lynly Star-Sung now has black hair to comply with the description of her given by Sibbi Black-Briar.</li>
<li>Sybille Stentor, Hert, and Hern, being vampires, now drop vampire dust when they die.</li>
<li>Imperial Soldiers and Penitus Oculatus agents who wear light armor will no longer use heavy Imperial shields.</li>
<li>AstridEnd has been tweaked to better resemble her non-horribly-burnt self (eye color matched to Astrid, eyes, nose, lips matched to Astrid, weight matched to Astrid).</li>
<li>Galmar Stone-Fist will now be classified as a CombatBarbarian class to better suit his choice of weapons and armor. He also now correctly gets the 500 health boost Legate Rikke gets.</li>
<li>Enthir will now properly fence goods after progressing the Thieves Guild quest line to activate him as a fence. His proper inventory will also be available.</li>
<li>Aringoth was incorrectly flagged as an Altmer. In game dialogue tells the player he is a Bosmer.</li>
<li>Aventus Aretino lacked AI packages to send him back to Honorhall Orphanage like he was supposed to be. (Bug #5054)</li>
<li>Calcelmo, Ondolemar, Runil, Viarmo, and Nelacar all needed facegen files exported to correct displaced eyelashes.</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Mjoll the Lioness is a two-handed warrior, but her favorite sword, Grimsever, is a one-handed glass sword. Rather than change Mjoll into a one-handed warrior (her combat style and perks show she was definitely intended to be two-handed), Grimsever is now a two-handed sword.</li>
<li>The original fix for changing Apple Pie to Meat Pie has been reverted. In its place, a new Meat Pie object has been created with a new texture and used to replace the two instances at the Bards College where they were specifically referred to as Meat Pie. This was done to fix an inconsistency with the Hearthfire DLC which solidified the original item as being intentionally called Apple Pie. The new meat pies have also been added to the leveled lists that publicans use to sell food at the inns.</li>
</ul>

<b>NIF Mesh and Texture Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The male and female 1st person Blades armor had some clipping issues which are now fixed. (Bug #5671)</li>
<li>Missing scabbards for the Blades sword, Dwarven sword, Dawnbreaker, and the Nightingale blade have been corrected. (weapons\akaviri\bladessword.nif, weapons\dwarven\dwarvensword.nif, weapons\nightingale\nightingalesword.nif)</li>
<li>The roof texture for the city of Whiterun had a visible line through it which has been corrected.</li>
</ul>

<b>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Previous fix for the entrance to The Midden has been updated to blend in better. (Bug #5438)</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">UDGP v1.1.1 - (2012-10-15)</p>

<ul>
<li>Generated an SEQ file, which will be maintained as needed for future updates. This file ensures the start-enabled retroactive fix scripts will be processed properly.</li>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Corrected the magic effects on Auriel's Bow to include restoration as the flagged skill and correct the description so that it shows up properly. (Bug #4792)</li>
<li>Several summoning spells could be blocked by high spell absorb/reflect. Summon Gargoyle, Conjure Mistman, Conjure Wrathman, and Conjure Boneman have all been fixed.</li>
<li>The broken Drain Vitality shout will be removed from the player upon loading a save.</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Prisoners in the radiant Rescue quest could thank you as though you were married if they happened to be a potential marriage target. Only actual spouses will deliver that response now.</li>
<li>In the quest "A New Order" (DLC1HunterBaseIntro) it was possible to kill the bear Gunmar wanted dead prior to talking to him but the dialogue would not acknowledge you'd killed the bear first due to the responses being out of order. (Bug #4735)</li>
<li>It was possible to continuously get the radiant quest "New Allegiances" (DLC1RV07) because the alias conditions were set up incorrectly to check for the Vampire keyword, which is impossible to add via script, instead of the faction that player turned vampires become members of. (Bug #3429) (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/17276">BGS Support #17276</a>)</li>
<li>Vampires will no longer react to the eclipse condition as though they're afraid of it. Dialogue conditions were not checking to be sure the NPCs had no vampire keyword. (Bug #4297)</li>
<li>On quest "Rings of Blood Magic" (DLC1RV08) it was possible for the boss monster chosen for the first alias to be disabled if the dungeon had been previously cleared.</li>
<li>In "Deceiving the Herd" (DLC1RV03) it was not possible to plant the note on the corpse of your victim because it was marked as a quest item in the alias.</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>More scripts with unnecessary debug information being logged have been silenced.</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>

<li>Merged the USKP's fix for the house purchase quest with the new data added by Hearthfire so that the childrens' bedrooms can be purchased properly in Whiterun and Solitude. (Bug #5137)</li>
<li>Temporarily including Hearthfire's compiled carriage script until the Papyrus source is available to merge changes the USKP made to this.</li>
</ul>

<p class="h">USKP v1.2.2 - (2012-10-05)</p>
<b>USKP General Updates</b>
<ul>
<li>The file has now been cleaned with TES5Edit, removing several dirty edits that have accumulated over time.</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li><s>The Companions radiant quest cycling script will no longer plaster the Papyrus logs with bug reports that could disrupt the radiant quest system.</s> [Official Patch 1.9]</li>
<li>Three dialogue branches of The Golden Claw (MS13) were setting the incorrect stage upon returning the claw if you had already found it ahead of being given the quest.</li>
<li>The quest in Solitude to retrieve Roggvir's Amulet of Talos for Greta (SolitudeFreeform03) had a dialogue fragment with a missing property which blocked completion of the quest when the player retrieved the amulet in advance. The script fragment was also missing the expected command to give the reward for this quest. (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/9918">BGS Support #9918</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed SwapAliasOnDeath for Riften's hostler and innkeeper (Ragged Flagon).</li>
<li>Teeba-Ei and Pactur will no longer wander Alessia Caro-style between Stonehills and Morthal once Sorli the Builder becomes Jarl.</li>
<li>Alias GuardCaptain in DailogueWhiterun is actually filled now, so Commander Caius will be exiled if the Stormcloaks take Whiterun.</li>
<li>Brunwulf Free-Winter will actually be present for his scripted conversation with Malthyr Elenil.</li>
<li>When curing the player's lycanthropy, the global variable that tracks the player being a werewolf was not reset to 0 like it should have been. (Bug #4715)</li>
<li>Several scenes at the Blue Palace made no sense when played after General Tullius is dead because they talk about him as though he's still alive. These have now been blocked from running if he's dead.</li>
<li>Narri was intended to be the backup for Valga Vinicia at the Dead Man's Drink, but there was no backup alias.</li>
<li>Julienne Lylvieve was to be Faida's backup for the Four Shield's tavern, but there was no backup alias.</li>
<li>The aliases for MQ201Party did not allow reserved references, which severely curtailed the the number of guests attending.</li>
<li>The other two Companions wilderness encounters will no longer resurrect dead Companions.</li>
<li>NPCs will now comment on the player's College of Winterhold robes, as was intended.</li>
<li>Blood's Honor (C04) could become stuck and not start due to an alias conflict on 3 corpses previously defined in the master quest that runs the Companions (C00). The conflicting aliases have been removed from C04 and their text storage settings transferred to the aliases on C00. (Bug #303)</li>
<li>Corrected one of Jorlief's lines about the Stormcloaks finding victory (it was checking that an empty variable was less than four; it now checks the number of holds the Imperials own: they start with four, so if they own any less than that, the Stormcloaks must indeed be finding victory across the land).</li>
<li>Niranye will no longer yell for people to browse her wares at all hours after becoming a fence.</li>
<li>Nurelion should no longer cry for the player to buy something while incapacitated in his bed.</li>
<li>Calixto will no longer give his tour if the player has no money to pay with.</li>
<li>Extensive polishing of DA08: Balgruuf's base actor is now essential, so if the quest is stopped after the blade is restored, he can't die and break quests; Nelkir, Dagny, and Frothar have been added to GovRuling and GovImperial so they'll be exiled to Solitude with their father (them staying in Dragonsreach was related to cut content; if the player does DA08 after taking Whiterun for the Stormcloaks, it will only be as awkward as "The Book of Love" if the Stormcloaks have Markarth); because the kids would lose all their unique dialogue if the quest was stopped, what dialogue that made sense with the cuts was duplicated into DialogueWhiterun, with half hour resets so they can say it all (and significantly dropping their annoyance factor now that they have more than one thing to say); their initial dialogue was given impossible conditions, as was a line from Balgruuf in exile wondering where his kids are; all the kids AI packages were removed from their DA08 aliases (all were vestigial and some caused them to do strange things if the blade was restored) so that they don't override their exile packages; Nelkir was given his DA08NelkirSneakAroundDragonsreach package on his base actor.</li>
</ul>

<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>EnchRobesFortifyMagickaRate02 had the incorrect base enchantment setting which would cause disenchantment of any items with this set to return the wrong learned enchantment. (Bug #4648)</li>
<li>The services faction for the East Empire Company was stealing wares out of the Bits and Pieces merchant chest instead of the intended chest. Its service location and time has also been corrected.</li>
<li>Corrected some Solitude AI packages that were intended to allow actors to explore the docks but instead sent them to their editor locations.</li>
<li>High Elf vampires will now perform proper head tracking.</li>
<li>ElderRaceVampire: checked "allow PC dialogue" and "allow pickpocket"</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Maurice's confidence value has been lowered so he won't be so inclined to charge into battle while being escorted to the Eldergleam Sanctuary. (Bug #4465)</li>
<li>Argonian female vampires were erroneously set to use the male behavior graph for their animations. (Bug #4484)</li>
<li>Olfina Gray-Mane, Brill, and Gorm are now essential owing to their roles as Housecarl, steward, and Housecarl, respectively.</li>
<li>Idgrod the Younger is no longer incorrectly set as Morthal's Housecarl and is no longer essential.</li>
<li>Services factions added to particular NPCs to be consistent with retroactive script.</li>
<li>Niranye, Gulum-Ei, Jaree-Ra, and Deeja had coffins in their city's hall of the dead and were no longer essential after certain quest paths were taken; they have been given the WIDeadBodyCleanUpScript.</li>
<li>Golldir is now correctly considered a unique actor.</li>
<li>Viola Giordano added to WindhelmViolaFaction so that she owns her house and door; Lortheim and Jora removed from faction, since there's no clear reason why they're in it in the first place.</li>
<li>CWBattle versions of Ulfric, Tullius, Galmar, and Rikke now actually look like their normal actor.</li>
<li>If Malthyr Elenil becomes the barkeep at the New Gnisis Corenerclub, he can now sell drinks as intended.</li>
<li><s>Bulfrek has dialogue indicating he isn't supposed to leave Dawnstar after the Imperials take over, so his Windhelm AI packs have been removed.</s> [USKP 2.0.5]</li>
<li>Vittoria Vici was intended to be a merchant (that's why she has that AI package where she stands behind the counter at the docks), but she was never put into the merchant factions that would allow her to sell even though she had a services faction.</li>
<li>Aquillius Aeresius, her creepy opposite-sex clone, is also in that services faction, implying he was to be her backup merchant.</li>
<li>Julienne Lylvieve and her mother Michel were not assigned a crime faction.</li>
<li>Muiri was no longer essential after "Mourning Never Comes" (DB03) but had no cleanup script.</li>
<li>Heimvar now has a coffin in Solitude's Hall of the Dead.</li>
<li>Nazeem will now go to his farm on weekends as he was supposed to.</li>
<li>Swapped the days two of Faryl Atheron's AI packages run -- now he sits outside the New Gnisis Cornerclub on weekends and works at the Hlaalu Farm on weekdays, rather than the reverse (consistent with his observation that he relaxes "when he can" as opposed to "nearly every day of the week").</li>
<li>Removed Aquillius Aeresius' counter AI package from his base actor so he doesn't crowd Vittoria while she works. It's been added to the EastEmpire alias in DialogueSolitude so that he'll resume when Vittoria is killed.</li>
<li>Aquillius' level has been bumped up to 4 and his negative health modifier removed.</li>
<li>Horkers now have their intended ability.</li>
<li>EncVampire02BossDarkElfM had his eyebrows set to BrowsMaleHumanoid03 so that he doesn't wind up with a grey face.</li>
<li>Legate Quentin Cipius is now properly enable parented to his camp so he isn't just exploring in the middle of nowhere anymore.</li>
<li>Enthir will now fence at all times rather than only when outside the Hall of Attainment, but also only after his fence setup has been completed.</li>
<li>Dravynea the Stoneweaver was supposed to perform backup vendor duties for Wuunferth the Unliving if he died but she did not have her vendor data set up.</li>
<li>Jorleif now sleeps in the proper location in Windhelm's palace.</li>
<li>Wuunferth the Unliving now sleeps in the proper location in Windhelm's palace.</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Nazir's hood will now appear correctly on beast races (could be taken from him if he was killed during DBDestroy).</li>
<li>The key to Niranye's safe will no longer be called "Darkwater Pit Key."</li>
<li>Ulfric's bracers, boots, and coat will now be the appropriate color in the player's inventory.</li>
<li>The Gilded Wristguards will no longer look like Nightingale Gloves in a female player's inventory.</li>
<li>The male wedding dress now has the correct first-person texture.</li>
</ul>

<b>Mesh and Texture Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The archery target has been replaced with a better resolution copy at 512x512 to match the quality of the rest of the game. (Bug #201)</li>
<li><s>Fixed a texture seam in the Windhelm walls. (textures\architecture\Windhelm\whoutwall_n.dds, textures\architecture\Windhelm\whoutwall.dds)</s> [Fixed by Bethesda in SSE]</li>
<li>Ebony helmets were not casting shadows and have been fixed.</li>
</ul>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The boss battle script in Geirmund's dungeon had some bad condition checks that could result in an endless loop which generated Papyrus errors in the log and impeded script processing because of it.</li>
<li>Edited WIDeadBodyCleanUpScript; normal script bails out and won't ever clean up the body if the actor is in the WINoBodyCleanup faction. This one just keeps the while loop going until they're out of it. [NR]</li>
</ul>

<b>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Dock pilings underneath the Dainty Sload outside of Solitude were not grounded. A rock has been placed under them to close the gap. (Bug #4732)</li>
<li>Two out of place sun sources were removed from Clan Cruel-Sea's house in Windhelm because they were making the house too bright. (Bug #4543)</li>
<li>Darkshade Copse was incorrectly marked as being in Falkreath Hold. It is in Eastmarch Hold. (Bug #4443)</li>
<li>Flickering meshes in Vlindrel Hall (MarkarthVlindrelHall) have been corrected by widening a room bounds portal. (Bug #4857)</li>
<li>Coffins in the various Halls of the Dead will now display the person interred within, as Whiterun's do.</li>
<li><s>The location name for Sunderstone Gorge (SunderstoneGorgeLocation) was mistakenly listed as Greywater Gorge.</s> [Official Patch 1.9]</li>
<li>Flagged a bed in Dragonsreach as owned by Nelkir so that he can sleep (it was owned by a common faction among the kids but the other two beds were owned by the other children; if one of them got to the common bed first, Nelkir couldn't sleep).</li>
<li>All navmesh edits for Breezehome have been removed to prevent running into a CTD caused by the Hearthfire DLC deleting one of the edited navmeshes.</li>
<li>Lydia's bed in Breezehome was facing the wrong way, making it impossible for her to use it because the furniture marker was outside the walls.</li>
</ul>

<b>Audio Fixes</b>

<li>The Drain Vitality shout incorrectly had the words for the Marked For Death shout assigned to it. (The DLC1DragonDrainVitalityShout0X copies, not the main DLC1DrainVitalityShout copy) (Bug #3555)</li>
<li>The Dawnguard version of the Matching Set perk (DLC1DawnguardItemPerk) did not properly account for wearing the light vs heavy versions of Dawnguard armor.</li>
<li>It was possible for the summon effect attached to the Durnehviir shout to be blocked by spell absorption.</li>
<li>Fixed a conflict between Dawnguard and a previous official patch that corrected conditions on the Limb Splitter perk. When Dawnguard added Dragonbone weapons to this, the previous fix was overwritten. These have now been merged.</li>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Arvak's skull was not removed from the player's inventory when returned to his master. (Bug #3446)</li>
<li>Fixed a conflict in Dawnguard's changes to "Blindsighted" (TG08B). Dawnguard changed some properties and scripting dealing with the vampire lord form while the USKP had fixed typos in the journal entries. These have now been merged.</li>
<li>Getting sent to Arcwind Point will no longer cause the word wall quest to stick in the journal. The location marker property had not been set on the trigger. (Bug #4515) (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/9652">BGS Support #9652</a>) [NR]</li>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Vampire facial data has been fixed to prevent the USKP from overwriting the changes Dawnguard made to vampires.</li>
<li>Radiant quest vampires did not have the ActorTypeUndead keyword assigned and would therefore show up on detect life spells and be immune to light-elemental damage. (Bug #4022)</li>
<li>Valerica shares the leveling script with Serana and needed to have her properties updated to stop Papyrus from logging bugs for it.</li>
</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>

</ul>

<b>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>A copy of Berit's ashes was mistakenly placed in Valerica's lab and has been replaced with a standard bonemeal.</li>

<p class="h">USKP v1.2.1 - (2012-09-12)</p>
<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The previous fix for "The Man Who Cried Wolf" (MS06Start) which stopped the quest on completion has been reverted. This quest will now be terminated when "The Wolf Queen Awakened" (MS06) has officially started. Aliases have been adjusted in MS06 so that they will not get lost during the transition. (Bug #3505)</li>
<li>Numerous dialogues that have race checks attached to them would not work for the vampire versions of those races. (Bug #425) (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/16557">BGS Support #16557</a>)</li>
<li>Awkward dialogue has been adjusted to only show up when appropriate, so long as it doesn't block possible quest progression. (Bug #307)</li>
<li>Some more guard dialogue in cities that wasn't accessible due to bad condition checks has been unlocked.</li>
<li>Four dialogue responses that TES5Edit reveals had bad condition checks on them have been repaired.
<ul>
<li>A random line Runil has in Falkreath about the graveyard.</li>
<li>Being able to ask Balgruuf and Proventus about shouts, in addition to Ulfric and Farengar.</li>
<li>Being able to ask Arniel to remind you what his quest wants you to do.</li>
<li>A random line Lilith Maiden-Loom says about horses in Whiterun Stables.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>During "The Forsworn Conspiracy" (MS01) it was possible, though unlikely, that Legate Emmanuel Admand could be picked for one of the guards to ambush you in the Talos shrine due to an oversight in the alias setup in MS01GuardAmbushQuest. [NR] (Bug #3442)</li>
<li>Using your Unrelenting Force shout at any time between being told to go get an Elder Scroll and arriving at the College would block dialogue allowing you to ask for entry because you're looking for a scroll. (Bug #2827)</li>
<li>Boti and Jofthor will no longer talk about Fastred being in Riften when she hasn't been moved there yet. (Bug #2639)</li>
<li>The Companions radiant quest "Escaped Criminal" (CR07) appears to not spawn a target and eventually ends itself and causes the quest to become stuck. Possibly due to CR07QuestScript using GetReference instead of GetActorReference on the alias for the criminal. (Bug #921)</li>
<li>Guard dialogue intended to be heard at Half Moon Mill was instead available to every guard in Falkreath Hold. (Bug #359)</li>
<li>"Ice Cold" (FreeformRiften07) could become stuck in a loop due to the failure to end the inventory event filter for ice wraith teeth. (Bug #3687)</li>
<li>Dialogue for Dravin's quest (FreeformMerryfairFarm) was not linked up properly. The player could ask about what happened to his bow without knowing it had been stolen yet.</li>
<li>One of Arngeir's scene dialogues at High Hrothgar was set to the wrong sound output mode. (Bug #3764)</li>
<li>Paarthurnax has several dialogue lines in his introduction scenes that are not loud enough to hear from the distances involved. (Bug #4074)</li>
<li>"Alteration Ritual Spell" (MGRitual05) was listed as a side quest, which displays the wrong artwork. It has been corrected to list as a Mages Guild quest. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Alteration_Ritual_Spell#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>The quest "Dark Brotherhood" registered a continuous update loop that is never shut down regardless of how the Dark Brotherhood quest line is resolved. Note that this quest will NOT be stopped due to dialogue and aliases within it that are used elsewhere.</li>
<li>In "Blood on the Ice" (MS11), the player's chest in Hjerim would not enable unless Wuunferth was arrested for the crime. (Bug #4070)</li>
<li>Viola and Arivanya are both required NPCs for "Blood on the Ice" (MS11) but were not properly added to the pre-quest that holds their essential aliases. If they die, MS11 will not start. If they are dead and MS11 has not yet started, they will be retroactively resurrected.</li>
<li>In MS11, the objective "Get Assistance from Jorleif" is never cleared during the quest.</li>
<li>MS11 was never counted toward the "Sideways" Steam achievement.</li>
<li>If Tova Shatter-Shield is dead (actually just disabled, but that's another story) because you completed "Mourning Never Comes" (DB03) before MS11, a substitute key for Hjerim will be made available by the USKP.</li>
<li>Also, if Tova Shatter-Shield was dead before starting MS11 (because you completed "Mourning Never Comes" (DB03)), and enough time had passed, the quest could never be started. (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/9827">BGS Support #9827</a>)
<li>If the player chooses not to sell the amulet to Claxito during MS11, they will have it identified when Wuunferth realizes what it is.</li>
<li>If MS11 has already passed the stage where it could be identified and the player is still carrying around the Strange Amulet, it will be swapped out for the Necromancer's Amulet they should have received.</li>
<li>MS11 would fail to start if the dead body in the Hall of the Dead in Windhelm had been purged by the corpse cleanup code. A new replacement body is generated to correct this as well as making the body's alias optional so the quest will start.</li>
<li>MS11 is never stopped when completed.</li>

<ul>
<li>SF_MS08AmbushScene_00057FAC contained a stray debug message that has now been commented out. (Bug #389)</li>
<li>Civil war map flags are not displaying properly. This is due to a bug in CWMapActivatorScript which does not clean up placed flag activators. The fix also removes bloat from excess flags that have been accumulating. It will be necessary to visit each affected map twice before the cleanup can take effect on existing saves though. (Bug #126)</li>
<li><s>The alias scripts attached to the player house doors could sometimes fail to complete the objectives due to badly unoptimized logic.</s> [USKP 1.2.3]</li>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The DLC1PlayerVampireQuest throws errors in the Papyrus log due to a missing property that was not updated correctly in the quest records.</li>
<li>Dawnguard caused the marker properties that act as the parent for the alchemy addition to Breezehome to become unset.

<li>The Katariah was erroneously flagged as a dungeon which could lead to several radiant quests choosing it as a target location and therefore requiring the full completion of the Dark Brotherhood quest line to retrieve the target object. (Bug #162)</li>
<li>Leveled list SublistEnchIronSwordStamina was populated by maces and has been corrected. This will also cascade to fix various quests that may have called this list as a reward. (Bug #390, 197)</li>

<li>Members of ChickenFaction will no longer flag crimes. (Bug #216)</li>
<li>Dragons and Draugr will no longer be considered enemies. Since Dragon Priests are friends to dragons and allies to draugr, this prevents the 3 from infighting with each other. (Bug #268)</li>
<li>Fortify archer potions were lending their effects to any type of weapon due to the AlchemySkillBoosts condition for Marksman not including a keyword check for an equipped bow. (Bug #1196)</li>

<b>Papyrus Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The retroactive removal script that was supposed to fix the Bards College item quests had a bug causing it to fail to remove the items properly and complete the objectives.</li>
<li>The Critter.psc script file had a few coding errors. CurrentMovementState == "Idle" in 3 cases should be CurrentMovementState = "Idle" (Bug #1736)</li>
<li>Also in Critter.psc, a bug introduced by Patch 1.6 has been fixed to allow form lists to correctly add items when accessed again.</li>
<li>Disabled the debug trace messages in WeaponRackActivateSCRIPT.</li>
<li>dunPotemasMS06BossFightDummy could start an infinite loop of attempts to make Potema cast spells if the dungeon is visited a second time. Even after she was dead. (Bug #994)</li>

<li>The Marked for Death shout will no longer stack with itself.</li>
<li>The script to drop dust in caves, ruins, etc. will no longer continue to run even when the player is not in the same cell. [NR]</li>
<li>Fixed a trigger box in Sheogorath's Arena so that it doesn't needlessly run updates every 10 seconds permanently though the player has left and the quest ended.</li>
<li>Bullseye was actually giving a 16% increase instead of 15% as deacribed.</li>
<li>SummonStormThrall was actually summoning a Storm Atronach instead of a Storm Thrall. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Conjure#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>EnchFortifyArticulation was incorrectly assigned keywords for sneak rather than for speechcraft. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Articulation#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The fix for "Pilgrimage" (FreeformRiften13) has been modified. The LItemSpellTomes50AllRestoration edit has been removed, and the script property for the quest reward has been pointed to LItemSpellTomes50Restoration instead.</li>
<li>It is now possible to complete "Season Unending" (MQ302) at High Hrothgar if you have not yet chosen sides in the civil war. Tullius and Ulfric could not access the proper topic before.</li>
<li><s>After the quest "Rise in the East" (MS10) is complete, traveling to Japhet's Folly will no longer trap the player there unable to fast-travel away, and with the bombardment still occurring</s> [Official Patch 1.9]</li>

<li>The three bound and hooded NPCs in the Abandoned Shack will no longer persist indefinitely (which they would whether alive or dead) when the Dark Brotherhood initiation quest "With Friends Like These..." (DB02) is completed</li>
<li>Proventus Avenicci will no longer complete the quest to deliver Balgruuf's Greatsword to him if the player doesn't actually have it (such as by placing it on a weapon rack/plaque, which will take quest item weapons)</li>
<li>Using the Thu'um on the Throat of the World (where Paarthunax is the only NPC around) will no longer cause the random Radiant quest courier to deliver the player a letter indicating a random Word Wall location (High Hrothgar was already excluded so this was probably an oversight)</li>
<li>"Ringmaker" (FreeformRiften18) will now have quest markers</li>
<li>After the quest "The Man Who Cried Wolf" (MS06Start) is completed, the very large purple shader graphic in Wolfskull Cave that accompanied the summoning of Queen Potema will no longer reappear when the cell resets</li>

<li>Added retroactive script for SolitudeFreeform03.</li>
<li>MG01Pointer will now correctly show Faralda as the quest target. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:College_Objective_Quest#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>The quest to rescue Derkeethus (DarkwaterCrossingDerkeethusRescueQuest) would not properly shut down when Derkeethus arrived in Darkwater Crossing because the AI package for his alias was not marked as owned by the quest and thus would never trigger the shutdown command. This would lead to his AI being permanently stuck trying to return home, making it impossible to marry him and stay at home, or recruit him as a Blade and have him stay at Sky Haven Temple. This would also result in him being permanently essential.</li>
<li>During The Black Star (DA01) one of Nelacar's speech challenges is checking his speech skill instead of the player's which causes the check to always fail.</li>
<li>In DialogueWhiterun, Amren's response intended for Redguards cannot be played because it erroneously checks to see if the player is a Nord.</li>
<li>Investing in Angeline Morrard's shop was erroneously setting Ulfberth's investment variable, allowing Angeline to accept infinite investments.</li>
<li>It was not possible to invest in Ghorza's shop in Markarth due to the dialogue option that transfers the gold not being linked up.</li>
<li>Thieves Guild radiant jobs will no longer select Heimskr's house as a target due to it being destroyed during the Battle of Whiterun. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Burglary_Job#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>The reward items for the Thieves Guild radiant quests will now appear on the shelves in the guildhall as expected and in the proper order.</li>
<li>Approaching Hjerim in Blood on the Ice (MS11) before being told to examine the crime scene would jump the quest ahead and strand you without access to the witnesses, blood trail, or markers for your next objectives.</li>
<li>The pointer quest to visit the College of Winterhold (MG01Pointer) will be shut down once the player has been accepted into the college. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:College_Objective_Quest#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>The Whiterun marriage alias in RelationshipMarriageFIN had an extra faction entry for Markarth which did not belong there.</li>
<li>In "Promises to Keep" (MS03) telling Maven about the plot to steal Frost would cancel the objective to steal the lineage papers even though Maven is still sending you to go get those. (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/16550">BGS Support #16550</a>)</li>
<li>The confrontation scene in Falion's Secret (FreeformMorthalA) does not run when the Jarl walks to where Falion is. The AI pack FreeformMorthalAJarlTraveltoFalion never initiates the scene. (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/16603">BGS Support #16603</a>)</li>
<li>Scare my Enemy (WIAssault02) does not clear the final objective or stop itself when you've been rewarded for attacking the target. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Scare_my_Enemy#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>

<li><s>Stump the dog should now properly follow Frodnar (Riverwood) and not get stuck indoors.</s> [USKP 2.0.5]</li>
<li>Eydis' (Old Hroldan Inn) hands/arms will no longer go through the countertop due to misaligned markers.</li>
<li>Helgird never sleeps. She's been moved to an editor location within range of her bed.</li>
<li>Sarthis Idren had a looping giant breath sound attached to him when it shouldn't have been.</li>
<li>Olava the Feeble's package to listen to Heimskr was blocked by her sandbox package.</li>
<li>Ugor will be marked as protected status during The Cursed Tribe (DA06) that can result from his death during the quest. (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/16597">BGS Support #16597</a>)</li>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>The dragon priest mask, Morokei, had an incorrect enchantment set. It now carries the correct one - EnchDragonPriestMaskMoonstone. (Bug #10618)</li>
<li>The enchantment on MQ203AkaviriKatana3 was erroneously set to the same enchantment as MQ203AkaviriKatana1 which resulted in the bonus damage not being correct.</li>
<li>Orcish War Axes, and all items based on the template, were set to a speed of 1.0 instead of 0.9.</li>
<li>The Amulet of Articulation had incorrect leveled reward settings that would cause the level 1 reward to be given out in all cases. The progression has been corrected as follows:
 <ul>
  <li>TGAmuletofArticulation01 - Level 1</li>
  <li>TGAmuletofArticulation02 - Level 8</li>
  <li>TGAmuletofArticulation03 - Level 15</li>

 </ul>
 (Bug #12235)

<li>Staff of Thunderbolts was erroneously set to cast Lightning instead of Thunderbolt.</li>
<li>The Executioner's Hoods used in With Friends Like These (DB02) were erroneously marked as Dwemer material.</li>

<b>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>One Thieves Guild cache barrel in Riften (0005EDAC) was not marked as owned by the players like the other two.</li>
<li>Moved a bench (650E3) in the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary that was too close to the (sloping) wall, so the camera would go through the wall into the void when the player sat down or stood up</li>
<li>Refixed the unusable bench in Whiterun's Bannered Mare (60343) so that it can finally be sat on. [NR]</li>
<li>Fixed Sibbi Black-Briar's bed in the Riften Jail so it won't allow him to get up and clip through the wall to the outside of the cell.</li>
<li>Opening scene trigger for MS07 in Solitude (000C588C) needed the local script copy removed since the quest is handling this via an alias on the same trigger. [NR]</li>

</ul>

<b>Scripts</b>
<ul>
<li>fxDustDropRandomSCRIPT has been rewritten with better logic to try and get rid of the ongoing problems with this script continuously updating.</li>
<li>WIAssault02LetterScript was not triggering the objective for WIAssault02 because it was using an OnActivate block instead of an OnRead block. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Scare_my_Enemy#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>

<p class="h">USKP v1.0 - (2012-04-07)</p>
<b>Game Mechanics Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>NPCs will no longer drop weapons or shields as separate objects, as these are never cleaned up which greatly adds to save bloating and litters the game world (the items will still appear to be dropped, but will access the corpse's inventory to be taken and be cleaned up with the corpse if left)</li>
<li><s>Ash Piles,</s> Ghostly Remains, Ice Piles and Wisp Cores will no longer permanently remain and bloat the save file (they will either disappear on exit of the cell or when the cell resets) [Official Patch 1.4.21]</li>
<li><s>Nirnroot glow objects will no longer stack, bloat the save and become blindingly bright; existing stacked glows will be removed</s> [Official Patch 1.6.89]</li>

<li><s>The Ancient Knowledge perk's 25% bonus when wearing full-Dwemer armor and 15% faster skill increase in Smithing will now work as indicated, rather than increasing all armor rating by 25% and adding 15 to the Smithing skill.</s> [Official Patch 1.9]</li>
<li>Argonian players (who have permanent Water Breathing) will no longer gasp for air when surfacing.</li>
<li>Fixed the missing Well Rested message and duplicated Well Rested and Rested bonuses appearing when the player slept in their home.</li>
<li>The player will now receive the Well Rested bonus from sleeping in the Winterhold College Arch Mage's quarters if they are the Arch Mage.</li>
<li>The Windhelm Barracks now has the correct music type (castle rather than dungeon) and followers won't react as though in a dungeon or cave.</li>
<li>Fixed the lever (7CFE7) in BlackreachArena (3,0) so that it will turn off the Dwemer spinning blade trap on the arena platform, as well as turning it on again (was also slightly seethrough-underside but this wasn't noticeable).</li>
<li><s>The merchant chest in Riverwood Trader had 20 instances of PerkInvestorRiverwoodWhiteriverTraderList added to it which was causing the shop's gold supply to be 20 times higher than it should be with the perk.</s> [Official Patch 1.9]</li>
<li>Argonians did not have the ability to use power bash attacks due to a missing attack keyword on their racial data.</li>
</ul>

<b>Quest and Dialogue Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Riftweald Manor, Mercer Frey's house in Riften, will no longer be accessible before the Thieves Guild quest The Pursuit without console commands, as accessing it earlier and picking up his plans would cause the Hard Answers quest to not start and break the questline (removed a barrel 3FFE6 from RiftenWorld RiftenCityEast 43,-24 that allowed early access) (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hard_Answers#Bugs">UESP</a>)
</li>
<li>The Thieves Guild quest "The Litany of Larceny" will no longer terminate immediately when the last item is obtained, rather then when it's returned to Delvin Mallory, which left the quest unfinishable.</li>
<li>The Thieves Guild ongoing job quest "The Numbers Job" will now correctly target the ledger in Haelga's Bunkhouse (Riften) rather than a static crate that left the job unfinishable (won't fix it if occurring currently; just cancel the job with Delvin and it won't reoccur)</li>
<li>If the player quits or fails a job in the Thieves Guild ongoing job quest "The Fishing Job" (TGRGF) this will no longer remove the target item type from the player even if it wasn't acquired from the mark yet.</li>
<li>If the player quits or fails a job in the Thieves Guild ongoing job quest "The Burglary Job" without having acquired the target item, it will be removed from the target location, as otherwise it couldn't be picked up and future Burglary Job items at that location would overlap it. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Burglary_Job#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li><s>If the player finds all 24 Unusual Gems before talking to Vex in the quest "No Stone Unturned" this will no longer make the quest unfinishable</s> [Official Patch 1.9] (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/9839">BGS Support #9839</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed Karliah going to Snow Veil Sanctum instead of returning to live at Nightingale Hall (which then didn't get restored; her dialog would also indicate she was in Nightingale Hall when she wasn't) at the conclusion of the Thieves Guild main questline (Darkness Returns)</li>
<li>After the Thieves Guild initiation quest "A Chance Arrangment", Brand-Shei will no longer remain permanently in the Riften jail; he was intended to be released in just over two minutes of real time, but a bug prevented this</li>

<li>Find Red Eagle's Sword will no longer restart if it's already completed by re-reading the book "The Legend of Red Eagle"</li>
<li>At the conclusion of Tending the Flames (Solitude Bards College), Viarmo will no longer tap the effigy of King Olaf with a mysterious hammer that appears from nowhere and then be stuck holding a torch permanently afterwords (note that due to bugged idle handling he still may have his hand in the holding position after the festival though), and the effigy's fire will now have its missing sound effect and flicker</li>
<li>In Tending the Flames, when Viarmo presents the rewritten Olaf verse to Jarl Elisif, he will now read the correct line if the player chose "Olaf sacked it in dragon form (Persuade)" for verse 4</li>
<li>Fixed Pantea Ateia's Tending the Flames festival greeting confusingly linking into her own quest's dialog</li>
<li>After the Bards College Rjorn's Drum quest is complete, Giraud Gemane will no longer have the "I found Rjorn's Drum" option (he would repeat the same dialog again, although not provide the reward again; this bug was introduced with the 1.4 patch)</li>
<li><s>If the three Bards College instruments are found before their related quests (Finn's Lute, Pantea's Flute and Rjorn's Drum) the misc. quest objectives to find them will no longer remain permanently incomplete after the quest ends</s> [USKP 1.2]</li>

<li>The player will no longer be able to return further (non-quest-item) Void Salts to Captain Wayfinder after the quest is complete and receive the reward each time</li>
<li>Esbern's misc. quest objective "Bring a Dragon Scale and a Dragon Bone to Esbern" will now complete properly when this is done</li>

<li>The misc. quest objective "Visit Proudspire Manor, your new home" will properly clear if the player first enters from a door other than the front door. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Proudspire_Manor#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li><s>Alessandra will now properly give the reward for the quest to bring her dagger to her father Andurs in Whiterun</s> [USKP 1.1]</li>
<li>The misc. quest (Favor110) to bring a copy of The Mirror to Captain Aldis, and the misc. quest (SolitudeFreeform01) from Angeline Morrard to ask Captain Aldis about her daughter will both now terminate properly if he's removed from the gameworld by the Stormcloaks capturing Solitude</li>
<li>The misc. quest (FreeFormMorthalB) to deliver Gorm's letter to to Captain Aldis will now terminate properly if he's removed from the gameworld by the Stormcloaks capturing Solitude, and will display its quest objective and target. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:For_the_Good_of_Morthal#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>An unfinishable misc. quest "Investigate the Bards College" objective will no longer be added if the player talks to one of several bards throughout Skyrim and has already visited the College and started the Tending the Flames quest</li>

<li>An unfinishable misc. quest "Speak to Degaine" objective will no longer be added if the player talks to Kleppr and has already started the quest to steal the statue of Dibella by talking to Degaine</li>
<li>The unfinishable misc. quest "Speak to Degaine" objective will be also now be removed if the player starts the Heart of Dibella by talking to Hamal directly</li>
<li>An unfinishable misc. quest "Visit the Shrine of Azura" objective will no longer be added if the player talks to innkeepers or wandering pilgrim Faldrus and has already started the quest The Black Star by visiting the shrine.</li>
<li>The mini-quest that can occur when the player assaults an NPC will now work properly: removed a leftover debug message, fixed quest objectives displaying script code and the quest letter will now properly advance the quest when read</li>
<li>Tolfdir's (Winterhold College) mini-quest to find his Alembic will now have journal objectives</li>
<li>J'zargo's Experiment (Winterhold College) will no longer break if more than three undead are destroyed with J'zargo's Flame Cloak Scrolls (the quest objective was to test them on three, but it's easy to go over this)</li>

<li>Urag gro-Shub's (Winterhold College) book finding quests (MGR20,MGR20b) will no longer break if the player has already found the book before starting the quest</li>

<li><s>Gallus's Encoded Journal (CEDA6) will now be removed properly from the player when Enthir takes it at the conclusion of the Thieves Guild quest "Hard Answers," and no longer remain in inventory as an undroppable quest item</s> [Official Patch 1.9]</li>
<li>The spiders in Redbelly Mine will no longer respawn there after the quest to get rid of them has been completed (otherwise they would be found roaming around while the miners were working whereas the quest indicated the mine was closed as soon as they were seen, and the player could kill them and finish the quest again; the mine will also be cleaned of spider detritus which may have been intended as it was already linked to an enable parent that was then never referenced)</li>
<li>Farengar will no longer tell College members they should seek to join if they have the aptitude.</li>
</ul>

<b>Actor and AI Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some encounter dragons not burning up nor giving the player a soul when slain (respawned dragons were not being properly reset) (<a href="https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/9655">BGS Support #9655</a>)</li>
<li>The Companions Skjor, Njada and possibly Aela should no longer come back to life if they're dead or have their corpses be found moving around in the wilderness while lying down as if dead; Skjor was the most notable of these (disabled unneeded random wilderness encounter WERJ11 which was causing this)</li>
<li>Brynjolf will no longer dismiss the player's conversation indicating that he's busy after the Thieves Guild questline</li>
<li>J'zargo (Winterhold College) will now cap at level 30 as all other non-quest followers do (other than Housecarls)</li>
<li><s>Added Lydia (Whiterun housecarl) to onload/retroactive so that she can now be married by the player if Breezehome has already been purchased</s> [Official Patch 1.5.24]</li>
<li>Lydia will no longer use the chairs in the player's bedroom or get into an AI loop of sitting and standing in the same place repeatedly</li>
<li>Faendal will no longer continue to visit Camilla Valerius if she's married to the player (and living in the player's house)</li>
<li>The corpses of Ulfric Stormcloak and Galmar Stone-Fist will no longer persist indefinitely in the Windhelm Palace of the Kings after the Battle for Windhelm is completed (they were neglected to be given coffins in the Hall of the Dead as well which was also rectified)</li>
<li>Ulfric Stormcloak and Galmar Stone-Fist's hands will no longer go through the map table in Windhelm's Palace of the Kings when they lean over it due to misaligned markers</li>
<li>If Illia is dismissed or otherwise loses her follower status, this will no longer prevent her from being talked to and recruited again (may have to talk to her twice to get her to follow if she's gotten into this state as the first attempt will fix the problem)</li>
<li>When bartering with wilderness Hunters, they will no longer take sold player items (which then disappear from their inventory) without paying for them, and gold paid to them by the player for their items will now properly add to their gold store (they were missing their merchant container; all Hunters will now share a common one for their faction so items sold to one be bought from another)</li>
<li>Imperial guards in Solitude will now have have the missing arrest dialog option recognizing if the player is Thane of Haafingar</li>
<li>The Bandit Marauder at Valtheim Towers will no longer remove 200 gold from the player if successfully intimidated</li>
<li>Randomly encountered thieves in the wilderness will now properly recognize if the player has Guild Master's or Nightingale armor equipped and defer accordingly</li>
<li>Legate Taurinus Duilis will no longer be locked out of the Morthal Guardhouse at night due to missing key assignments (both he and the door)</li>
<li>Bothela (Hag's Cure, Markarth) will now sleep properly (package wasn't set up properly) as otherwise she was very difficult to rob when assigned to by the Thieves Guild</li>
<li>If Cairine (Markarth Warrens) is "killed" she will no longer lie still as if dead yet remain able to blink, engage in dialog and detect the player until "killed" a second time (this strange behavior may have made her very difficult or impossible to pickpocket for the Thieves Guild quest The Fishing Job)</li>
<li><s>Gharol (Burguk's Longhouse) will now have the option to train Heavy Armor if the player's skill is 50 to 74 (she's an Expert, not Common-level trainer)</s> [Official Patch 1.9]</li>
<li><s>Louis Letrush should no longer duplicate at the Whiterun Stables fast-travel marker or attack the player for no apparent reason</s> [Official Patch 1.8]</li>
<li>The "dead" skeleton (7502A) on a bier in Tamriel (24,18) will no longer add a copy of the book The Doors of Oblivion to its inventory every time it is activated</li>
<li>Brenuin's (Whiterun) urn in the catacombs will now properly enable if he dies (ref. was pointing to a fire shader instead of the urn)</li>
<li>Grosta and Gralnach had no key to their house at Heartwood Mill which prevented them from coming out when they were supposed to. A vanilla key for this did not exist, so a new one was created for them. It has also been assigned to the door lock.</li>
<li>Fixed the following named, non-respawning, non-essential NPC's missing their cleanup script, so depending on their death location their corpses could persist overly or indefinitely: Acolyte Jenssen (assigned unused urn E4B5F), Adeber (assigned unused coffin DEF28), Adisla (assigned unused urn F93DF), Aela the Huntress, Aeri, Ahkari, Ainethach, Alain Dufont, Alva, Alvor, Angi, Angrenor Once-Honored (assigned intended coffin F93DE), Angvid, Annekke Crag-Jumper, Aquillius Aeresius (assigned unused coffin 8618D), Aranea Ienith, Arcadia (assigned unused coffin E4BF6), Ardwen, Argis the Bulwark, Aringoth (assigned unused coffin 102DD1), Arnskar Ember-Master (assigned unused coffin 102DFE), Arob, Aspiring Mage, Atahbah, Atar, Athis, Atub, Azzada Lylvieve, Badnir, Bagrak, Barknar, Bassianus Axius, Beitild, Belchimac, Belrand, Bendt (assigned unused urn 863C6), Benor, Birna, Bjartur (assigned unused urn 86176), Bodil, Bolfrida Brandy-Mug, Bolund, Bor, Borgakh the Steel Heart, Borgny, Bothela (assigned unused coffin DEF2C), Boti, Brelas (assigned unused coffin F524E), Brelyna Maryon, Briehl (assigned unused coffin EC775), Bulfrek, Calder, Camilla Valerius, Captain Lonely-Gale (assigned unused coffin F5256), Captain Wayfinder, Chief Burguk, Chief Larak, Chief Mauhulakh, Cynric Endell, Dagur, Dalan Merchad, Delacourt, Derkeethus, Dravynea the Stoneweaver, Drelas, Dro'marash, Dulug, Dushnamub, Edith, Eimar, Eola, Embry, Enmon, Erik the Slayer, Eris, Faendal, Faida, Fastred, Fianna, Filnjar, Frida, Froki Whetted-Blade, Fruki, Fultheim, Gadba gro-Largash, Ganna Uriel, Garakh, Gemma Uriel, Gerda, Gerdur, Gestur Rockbreaker, Ghak, Ghamorz, Gharol, Ghorbash the Iron Hand, Gilfre, Gjak, Gloth, Golldir, Gorm, Grogmar gro-Burzag, Grosta, Gul, Gularzob, Gunding, Guthrum, Gwendolyn, Gwilin, Hadring, Haran, Helvard, Hern, Hert, Hilde, Hod, Hogni Red-Arm, Horgeir, Hroggar, Iddra, Indara Caerellia, Iona, Irgnir, J'darr, J'datharr, J'zargo, Jervar, Jenassa, Jesper, Jofthor, Jonna, Jordis the Sword-Maiden, Jorgen, Jouane Manette, Julienne Lylvieve, Kaie, Karita, Karl, Keeper Carcette, Kesh the Clean, Kharjo, Khayla, Kjar, Kjeld, Kjeld the Younger, Klimmek, Kodrir, Kust, Lami, Lash gra-Dushnikh, Leifur, Leigelf, Lemkil, Leontius Salvius, Lob, Lod, Lodvar, Lond, Luaffyn, Lu'ah Al-Skaven, Lucan Valerius, Lydia, Lynly Star-Sung, Ma'dran, Ma'jhad, Ma'randru-jo, Madena, Mahk, Malborn, Marcurio, Mathies, Maurice Jondrelle, Mena, Michel Lylvieve, Margret (assigned unused coffin DEF4C), Mogdurz, Mralki, Mul gro-Largash, Murbul, Nagrub, Narri, Nimriel, Nirya, Njada Stonearm, Odfel, Oglub, Ogol, Olda, Olur, Onmund, Orgnar, Perth, Ra'zhinda, Ragnar, Ranmir, Ravam Verethi, Reldith, Revyn Sadri (assigned intended coffin F5249), Rexus, Rhorlak, Ria, Roggi Knot-Beard, Rorik, Runil, Rustleif, Safia, Sanyon, Sarthis Idren, Seren, Sergius Turrianus, Sharamph, Shel, Shuftharz, Sifnar Ironkettle (assigned unused coffin F93EC), Sigrid, Sigurd (assigned new urn xx01A7D3), Silus Vesuius, Sirgar, Skulvar Sable-Hilt, Snorried, Solaf, Sondas Drenim, Stenvar, Sulla Trebatius, Sven, Swanhvir, Sylgja, Teeba-Ei, Temba Wide-Arm, Thadgeir, Thorgar, Thoring, Tilma, Torvar, Tulvur, Tuthul, Ugor, Ulfr the Blind, Umana, Umurn, Urog, Valdr, Valga Vinicia, Verner Rock-Chucker, Vorstag, Willem (assigned unused coffin DEF2A), Wilmuth, Wuunferth the Unliving (assigned new coffin xx01AD36), Xander, Yatul, Zaynabi</li>

<li>Created USKPSPatioWallColumn.NIF and placed in Tamriel at the Solitude gates (-18,25) to cover exposed hollow ends on a fence piece</li>
<li>Added end pieces with collision to resolve hollow/seethrough fence beam ends and missing stone fenceposts on the Thalmor embassy entrance (Meshes\Architecture\Solitude\SThalmorEmbassy.NIF)</li>
<li>Closed a seethrough triangular hole of missing polys at the roof apex of inn side room meshes (Meshes\Architecture\Farmhouse\Interior\FarmIntInnEnd03/4/6.NIFs)</li>
<li>Fixed overlapping faces, added a missing stone pillar to properly complete the fence including new collision for it Fixed Havok collision on the back door which was allowing the player to walk through the mesh, and removed a bad node that was causing problems with snow shader mods in the exterior Thalmor Embassy building (Meshes\Architecture\Solitude\SThalmorEmbassy.NIF)</li>
<li>Closed two seethrough gaps between the base of Belethor's General Goods and the roadway near Breezehome in Whiterun (Meshes\Architecture\Whiterun\WRTerrain\WRDrunkenHuntsmanBase.NIF) [note that the mesh name doesn't match the actual object]</li>
<li>Closed a seethrough gap under the side door of the Drunken Huntsman tavern and a seethrough hole into the void by the base of the side door stairway (Meshes\Architecture\Whiterun\WRTerrain\WRDryGoodsBase.NIF) [note that the mesh name doesn't match the actual object]</li>

</ul>

<b>Item Fixes</b>
<ul>
<li>All followers will no longer have invisible Hunting Bows that can't be removed from them that they would use even in preference to much better bows they were given; they will now be visible and can be removed from the follower normally</li>
<li><s>Esbern's Potion (E6DF5) will now properly grant the player the permanent Dragon Infusion ability</s> [Official Patch 1.9]</li>
<li>The health damage effect of the Silent Moons enchantment of Lunar weapons will now work properly</li>
<li>Gourds and Apple Cabbage Soup are no longer missing their sound effects when eaten</li>
<li>Completely filled Petty, Lesser, Common, and Greater Soul Gems will no longer empty when dropped or put in a container (partially filled Lesser, Common, and Greater Soul Gems will still empty and this is by design so that they may be reused if incompletely filled)</li>
<li>The White Phial (Empty) (2C25A) will no longer endlessly duplicate if activated in player inventory</li>
<li>Wylandriah's Soul Gem (FFRiften14SoulGem) now has no soul capacity, as otherwise it could capture a soul and then be used up at an enchanter (even though it is a quest item) which broke the quest to retrieve it. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hunt_and_Gather#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>Removed the description "Especially effective against undead." from the Silver Sword (10AA19) and Silver Greatsword (10C6FB) as if one is enchanted the enchantment type, magnitude, duration and charge bar won't display due to an engine bug (so that the player is still advised of the benefit against the undead, made a new loading screen)</li>
<li><s>The Ebony Blade (4838F) and Headsman's Axe (BE25E), both two-handed weapons, will no longer behave like one-handed weapons in their perk effects and other characteristics</s> [Official Patch 1.9]</li>
<li>Blades Shields (4F912) will now appear properly on Vampiric players of all races. (<a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ebony#Bugs">UESP</a>)</li>
<li>Stormcloak Officer Helmets (86985) and Ancient Nord Helmets (1FD77/B/C) will now display properly on armor mannequins</li>
<li>The Gauntlets (EAFD2) and Boots (EAFD3) of the Old Gods will no longer disappear if the full set is being worn</li>
<li><s>Banded Iron (13948), Elven Gilded (1392A), and Studded (13B2A) armors will now provide the appropriate Matching Set perks (they are only available in cuirass/greaves and didn't match up with the boots/helmet/gauntlets of the same material)</s> [Official Patch 1.9]</li>
<li>Daedric Bows (139B5) and 27 enchanted varieties based on them now have the correct bash sound effect</li>
<li><s>Changed the Elven Boots of Eminent Stamina (10DF88) into boots as they incorrectly appeared as a suit of armor (in the boots leveled list, has boots price and boots internal name so appears was intended to be boots but incorrect template was used)</s> [Official Patch 1.9]</li>
<li>The level 32-39 Shield of Solitude (10EB63) now has the correct level enchantment, not the weaker one for the level 25-31 version</li>
<li>The Grand Staff of Charming (29B91) now has the correct enchantment of mass charm, not calm as the weaker Staff of Calm does</li>
<li>Corrected Fine Armguards (86990) not being categorized as armor</li>
<li>Corrected the Flawless Amethyst item (6851E) being miscategorized as clutter rather than a gem</li>
<li>The Bond of Matrimony (C5809) and Linwe's Boots/Armor/Gloves/Hood (108543/4/5/6) are now blocked from disenchanting as they should have been, as the resulting enchantment can't be applied to anything</li>
<li>Corrected both Blade of Woe items (964C9/9CCDC) being improvable at a grindstone without requiring any materials, unlike all other items (both have keywords indicating they should require a Steel Ingot)</li>
<li>Corrected Dragonplate Boots (13965) and 16 enchanted variants, Gauntlets (13967) and 16 enchanted variants, and Helmet (13969) and 28 enchanted variants requiring Dragon Scales rather than Bone to improve them, though they are crafted of Dragon Bone, have a clearly different appearance than their Scale counterparts and the correct Dragonplate keyword</li>
<li>The Jagged Crown (DA750) is now properly listed for smithing and other purposes as being Dragonplate rather than Daedric, and the Masque of Clavicus Vile (D2846) as Daedric rather than Ebony</li>
<li>Fixed the following weapons and armor not being improvable at a workbench or grindstone: Amulet of Articulation (9DFF7/F6904/D/E/F/10/11) [yes, these amulets are actually armor and their internal name indicates that this is intentional], Diadem of the Savant (F9904) [also an armor amulet as previous], Dragon Priest Dagger (1C1FE), Drainblood Battleaxe (F82FA), Drainheart Sword (F71DD), Drainspell Bow (F82FC), Ebony Blade (4838F), Fine Armguards (86990), Gilded Wristguards (E84C1), Headsman's Axe (BE25E), Honed Falmer Sword (6F6FF), Honed Falmer War Axe (6F700), Jagged Crown (DA750), Keening (6A13C), Masque of Clavicus Vile (D2846), (Notched) Pickaxe (1019D4/E3C16), Scaled Horn Armor (1B3A4), Nightingale Blade (F6527) [this is the highest-level one; the other four could already be improved, and like the Nord Hero Bow this one had an entry but it was set up wrong, so was clearly intended], Shield of Solitude (9E023/10EB62/3/4/5), Shield of Ysgramor (E41D8), Shiv (426C8), Shrouded Cowl Maskless (5ABC4), Silver Sword/Greatsword (10AA19/10C6FB), Skyforge Steel Dagger (9F25D), Studded Imperial Armor (13ED8 - also 6 enchanted variants can now be improved), Supple Ancient Nord Bow (5D179), The Woodsman's Friend (22265), Tumblerbane Gloves (F5981), Ulfric's Bracers (6230B), Woodcutter's Axe (2F2F4) [the almost-identical Poacher's Axe could be improved], Worn Shrouded Armor/Boots/Cowl/Gloves (10EB5B/C/D/E) and Wuuthrad (956B5) [The justification for calling these omissions bugs are comments made pre-release and a loading screen that indicates that <b>all</b> weapons and armor may improved; to avoid arbitrary decisions of materials, magnitude or feasibility I did not add missing crafting options or perk keywords, nor change items that don't appear in the unmodded gameworld; if you use a crafting mod such as the Lost Art of the Blacksmith or weapon improvement mod such as WAF along with the USKP they will not conflict; ie multiple entries won't appear in the stations' menus]</li>
</ul>

<b>Placement/Layout/Ownership and other World Object Fixes</b>
<i>Tamriel (outdoor) Worldspace</i>
<ul>
<li>The torches on sconce activators will no longer duplicate-in-place (also adding slightly to bloat) when their cells respawn; the duplicate(s) would remain when the player picked up the newest torch. These are all associated with RemovableTorchSconce01SCRIPT and the RemovableTorchSconce01 activator.</li>
<li>Moved the Khajiit caravan's merchant chest (74355) which was underground near the Dawnstar mine (8,25) as it could be activated and looted through the ground</li>
<li>The front door to Klimmek's house in Ivarstead (17790) will no longer clip through the fake placeholder door behind it when activated.</li>
<li>The alchemy lab/crafting table (E68A7) will no longer completely embed in a Workbench and a chest (E68A8) will no longer embed in another chest when the Imperials are occupying the fort due to missing enable parents, and replaced the erroneous static/unusable grindstone BlacksmithSharpeningWheel01 (B409D) with a usable CraftingBlacksmithSharpeningWheel at Fort Amol (24,-6)</li>
<li>A wooden barricade (E1FAA) near the Rift Imperial camp now has its missing enable parent so won't appear before or after the camp does</li>
<li>For a road signpost that had two Markarth signs at right angles, replaced the erroneous one (EDC2C) with the Solitude sign it should have been (-21,6)</li>
<li>Grounded a bedroll (9688E) in the Reach Imperial Camp (-40,8) that was hovering over the roof of a tent, above where it had been intended to be placed</li>
<li>Moved a cliff face (95965) so that there wasn't a hole between it and another cliff face that the player could fall in, and nothing but console commands or a reload could get them out (-21,16)</li>
<li>Replaced the erroneous static/unusable grindstone BlacksmithSharpeningWheel01 (798AC) with a usable CraftingBlacksmithSharpeningWheel; also repositioned it as it was floating, and grounded the nearby forge as it was slightly floating on the roof of Fort Sungard (-17,-6)</li>
<li>Fixed the following load doors incorrectly using non-animated object FarmhouseDoor01 rather than FarmhouseDoorL01 so they didn't animate when activated: DB0E8 (-23,4), 1F7D7 (-37,3), 19974 (-29,1), 1656B/D (26,-2), 1636E (-11,-15), 16365 (7,6), 16356 (36,8), 16353 (35,8), 1633A (34,6), 1630A (26,8), 162D5 (27,8) [also had a seethrough gap as was misaligned], 177B9 (-9,16), 177B4 (-10,17), 177B2/8 (-9,15), 177AF/BB (-10,16), 17752 (-25,19), 177BD/DFF11 (-10,-15)</li>
<li>Fixed unmineable gold veins (10E570) in (11,28), (10E634) in (30,-26), (10E653) in (25,-19), (10D6F1) in (-9,-2), (10E5FC) in (45,-32) and an unmineable iron vein (10E608) in (34,-28)</li>
<li>The statue of Azura (33DCB) in ShrineOfAzuraExterior03 (26,19) can now be seen at a distance rather than just disappearing (only 116KB so doesn't really even need a LOD mesh)</li>
<li>Slightly moved the longship Northwind (9A38E) at the Windhelm docks (34,8) so that its side isn't clipping into the pier</li>
<li>Removed see-through land discontinuity caused by misplaced MountainTrim02ReachGrass01 piece (8DCA4) in (-36,-8)</li>
<li>Covered see-through land discontinuity under MountainTrim01FallForestDirt01 (B9386) in (28,-23) [scaled/moved rock BA04A to hide it]</li>
