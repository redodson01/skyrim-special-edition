DESCRIPTION
===========

Simple, immersive, and configurable alternative death system. When defeated in battle, revive by consuming a Dragon Soul or pray for Divine Intervention.

When defeated in battle, you will fall to your knees and be given a choice to either revive on the spot by consuming a Dragon Soul or pray to be transported to the last place you slept by Divine Intervention.

Revival carries no penalty besides losing a Dragon Soul. Divine Intervention risks losing a portion of your gold and experience. This risk increases every time you invoke it, and can only be reset by gaining a level. Werewolves and Vampire Lords risk being denied Divine Intervention and may be forced into transformation instead.

There are some places where Divine Intervention is impossible. If you are about to die in such a place and you have no Dragon Souls, you will truly die and the last save game will be reloaded.

Death's Door activates automatically after completing the Unbound quest and comes with an MCM menu where every aspect can be adjusted to your liking.

On rare occasions you may get you stuck in a pose and be unable to move. Enter the following in the console to fix it:

COMPATIBILITY
=============

Should be compatible with everything except other death alternative mods.

Divine Intervention is disabled in certain places to prevent quests from breaking, think of the Soul Cairn, Sovngarde, and the Thalmor Embassy. I think I got them all but it is possible that I missed one or two. Similar locations added by other mods can be covered by adding them to the DETHTeleportSpecialLocations form list.
