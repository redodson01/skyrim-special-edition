nexusDescription="[color=#f1c232][size=4][center]﻿[/center]Features[/size][/color]\n<br />[size=3]Skyrim's bash is OP and boring. Every single bash staggers the enemy; this turns the late combat gameplay into \"bash-&gt;do a few swings-&gt;rinse and repeat\" no matter what combat overhaul you've installed. This mod changes that by doing the following things:[/size]   \n<br />﻿\n<br />[left][size=3]Light bash no longer has hit frame. This means doing a light bash alone﻿ will not hit and stagger an enemy.\n<br />[/size][/left][center][img]https://i.imgur.com/y02Erqm.gif[/img]﻿﻿﻿[/center][center]﻿no more light bash spamming[/center][left]\n<br />[size=3]Light bash is now turned into \"parry\". When you bash while getting hit, you parry the incoming attack and stagger the attacker. Successful parries do not cost stamina.\n<br />[/size][/left][left][center][/center][/left][center]﻿[img]https://i.imgur.com/CiEOlb0.gif[/img]﻿\n<br />Parry only happens at the precise moment of you getting hit[/center]\n<br />[size=3]Parrying an incoming projectile deflects the projectile back at the enemy.[/size]\n<br />﻿[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/o2HJogt.gif[/img]﻿[/center][size=2][center]Works for magic projectiles(fireballs, ice spikes...) too\n<br />[color=#b6b6b6]Projectile parrying is done by hooking the projectile collision function; \n<br />no workarounds(spawning a new projectile to shoot back/giving a perk to negate projectile damage) is used. \n<br />The projectile that you deflect back is the original projectile. [/color][/center][/size][size=3]With the above changes, bashing/parrying is now much more interesting and dynamic. Parrying is no longer a no brainer; it's a skill you need to practice on and harness. This won't fundamentally change Skyrim's combat feel, but will spice things up a lot, and it feels great in both 1st and 3rd person.\n<br />[center][youtube]-Vcc2XaTdDQ[/youtube][/center][center]It has custom SFX﻿[/center][center]﻿[/center][/size][size=3]Everything is done through a lightweight SKSE plugin paired with a esl to store some sound records. \n<br />[/size]\n<br />[center][youtube]kLbVoy-hZpI[/youtube][/center]\n<br />[center][/center]\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=4]Settings[/size][/color]\n<br />The mod comes with an .ini file in which you can tweak some settings for this mod to better suit your LO. You can disable weapon/shield parry or projectile parry or tweak the visual feedbacks parrying does(including a God-Of-War like slow time effect).\n<br />\n<br />By default, successful parrying won't cost you any stamina. If you use mods that speed up stamina recovery however, you might want to disable that option for a more balanced experience.\n<br />\n<br />You can also tweak start and ending time of your parrying window during the parry animation, if you feel parrying is too easy.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=4]Compatibility[/size][/color]\n<br />Compatible with every single combat mods/behavior mods. Really.\n<br />Incompatible with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69839]Better God Modes[/url]\n<br />If you use Ersh's precision beta, make sure you update the mod to 0.4 or higher versions, otherwise attacks cannot be properly parried.\n<br />There will be an update on Valhalla Combat beta soon that allows Elden Parry to do extra stun damage to NPCs.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=4]FAQ\n<br />[/size][/color]Q: Can you make a script-free timed block mod too?\n<br />A: I've been working on a combat overhaul that has this feature for a while now; stay tuned :)\n<br />\n<br />Q: Does this work in 1st/3rd person?\n<br />A: Yes!\n<br />\n<br />Q: How's the parry different from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43436]Zxlice's Backstab and Parry[/url]?\n<br />A: Zxlice's parry is done differently. It does not cancel light bash hitframe. The parry can be triggered by landing a bash on an attacking enemy at any time during their attacking animation; imo, this makes parrying way too easy and bashing only more OP. In addition, Zxlice's parry is made only for melee attacks while Elden Parry works for projectiles too. I wouldn't suggest enabling Zxlice's parry due to its overlapping functionality. However, you can keep its backstab by turning the parrying option off in its MCM.\n<br />\n<br />Q: I crashed!\n<br />A: Please provide me a crashlog as well as the things happening when the crash happened; this will greatly help me debug.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=4]Credits[/size][/color]\n<br />Gigabrain clib people\n<br />Ersh for helping me with a lot of Havok stuff(without which projectile deflection won't be possible) and precision API\n<br />Fenix for helping me RE the playsound function\n<br />MaxSu for his Simple Block Sparks source code\n<br />Elden Ring for the inspiration to turn bash into parry\n<br />绝伦少年 for the cover image\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f1c232][size=3]Source[/size][/color]\n<br />https://github.com/D7ry/EldenParry"
