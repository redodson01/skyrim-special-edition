nexusDescription="Why do I have to become a member of the Thieve's Guild to sell stolen stuff to anyone!? Or reach a high level of Speechcraft to convince a merchant that the vegetables I'm selling aren't hot? How and why does everyone know what was stolen? I understand high stakes items from Jarls and Nobles, but pickpocketing bandits shouldn't require me becoming a guild member just to pawn off shitty silver rings and stolen alcohol.\n<br />\n<br />If this sounds like your mode of thinking, then congratulations! You found the perfect mod for you!\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=3]What Does This Mod Do?[/size]\n<br />[/u][/b]\n<br />Simple: it enables Khajiit Caravan factions to buy stolen goods.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]no perks required\n<br />[*]no guilds to join\n<br />[*]no quests to complete\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][size=3]Is This Balanced/Lore-Friendly?[/size][/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />You bet your ass it is. Sure, stealing a gold necklace from Balgruuf and trying to pawn it to Belethor would be pretty suspect, but Khajiit caravans move between cities all the time; and they don't even go in them. How would they get word of what's stolen? Some of them are thieves themselves too! It would make sense that if anyone is peddling stolen goods (unawaringly or knowingly) it would be them.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=3]Installation[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[/u][/b]Just download the file, and move the .esp into your [code]﻿[/code][code]Skyrim Special Edition/Data/[/code] folder. If you use Mod Organizer, just make sure your .esp is on the top level.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=3]Requirements[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[/u][/b]No requirements except for a legit copy of Skyrim.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=3]Compatibility[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />This should be compatible with almost any mod. I don't have a single mod that steps on this one's toes, but if you have issues, feel free to ask me!\n<br />Khajiits Steal Too should also allow mod-added NPCs to these caravans (say if you ported [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88677]PD Caravans Extension[/url]﻿) as long as the mod author doesn't add [i]new[/i] caravans."
