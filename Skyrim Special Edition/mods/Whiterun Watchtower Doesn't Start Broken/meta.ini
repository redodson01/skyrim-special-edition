Does exactly what the description says:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Undamaged Tower[/b]: Before \"Dragon Rising\" (Quest where you and Irileth defeat your first dragon and you learn \"Fus\"), the tower is undamaged.\n<br />[*][b]Damaged Tower[/b]: When the attack begins, the tower will revert back to vanilla. (Burning for a while, non burning broken tower after)\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The change happens automatically, nothing for you to do. No issues at all with the main quest, completely independent from it.\n<br />\n<br />Regarding the design: I'm not an expert decorator and the new fort is not perfect. It's not a beautiful redesign or a huge change to the place. This is just a small mod to prevent the immersion-breaking realization that the tower has always been broken before the attack. \n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/yG0hLs5.jpeg[/img][/center]\n<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n<br />FAQ:\n<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n<br />\n<br />[b]Does this mod make changes to any vanilla script? \n<br />[/b]No, no changes. Those files are untouched completely, so compatible with anything that might change the main quest too.\n<br />\n<br />[b]What is the script for?[/b]\n<br />When you are near the doors of whiterun (from the outside), the most simple script in the world asks the game if Dragon Rising has started/been completed. If this is the case, the tower reverts back to vanilla. Otherwise, nothing happens.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Is the new tower navmeshed?\n<br />[/b]I respected the original navmesh of vanilla, so it works for both states of the tower. This means guards should patrol without colliding with stuff when walking around: but if something attacks the tower like a wolf or bandit, they might have a brief moment of something blocking their way. Everything reverts to vanilla during and after the attack anyway, so it shouldn't be a big deal.\n<br />\n<br />In order for the navmesh to work both in the broken and unbroken state of the tower, I had to be somewhat creative, so the layout of the fort shows a bit of an already somewhat old/broken tower, but it's well defended with spikes and patrols, so the tower still looks like it serves its purpose: Making sure no threats to Whiterun come from the western road.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Can I install this midgame?\n<br />[/b]Yes, but if you've already completed Dragon Rising, the tower will be unbroken until you visit the entrance of Whiterun, since that's when my mini-script asks the game for the state of the quest.\n<br />\n<br />[b]How does the tower look in the distance?\n<br />[/b]From the distance, the LOD will look like the broken tower. Not sure how dyndolod works or if it will affect this mod. The good thing is: the layout of the broken and unbroken tower is very similar, so it shouldn't be too noticeable.\n<br />\n<br />[b]I found a bug! [/b]\n<br />Feel free to reach out if you encounter a bug, mod is quite light so besides the mini-fort not looking amazing, there shouldn't be any issues.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />-\n<br />[center][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][i]This mod is now included in[/i][/font][url=https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/qdurkx][img]https://i.imgur.com/YfgAA8V.png[/img][/url]﻿[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][i]\n<br />[/i][/font][size=3][b]?️[/b] [b]A Dynamic World - ? [b]Roleplaying - [b]?
