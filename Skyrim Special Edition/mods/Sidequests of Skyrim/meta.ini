Either ignore it, or use the disposition fix dialog option to fix it for any NPC.[/list]\n<br />[b]FAQ[/b]\n<br />[quote]﻿Q: How come some NPC isn't giving me the quest dialog?\n<br />A: Some quests have blocking dialog that prevents all other dialog from appearing. The NPC might have just given you a quest and is in cooldown. You might also be doing a side quest already: you can only have 1 of these active at any time.\n<br />\n<br />Q: The quest is asking me to go somewhere I can't reach or find someone who I can't find.\n<br />A: This is because you have mods that added locations to the game which are not completely compatible with the radiant quests system. Simply cancel the quest by talking to the quest giver, by [url=https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/54245/54245-1629853956-410597624.png]ripping up the quest note[/url]﻿, or by cancelling it in the [url=https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/54245/54245-1629853947-949659969.png]MCM[/url]﻿.\n<br />\n<br />Q: The quest giver is gone!\n<br />A: There are other processes in the game that will delete NPCs as part of their clean up. If the NPC is gone, just give up the quest.\n<br />\n<br />Q: What's the benefit of doing these quests?\n<br />A: Non-poor NPCs will give you gold. And you will improve your [url=http://https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Disposition]disposition[/url]﻿ with NPCs you help.\n<br />\n<br />Q: What's the benefit of improving [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Disposition]disposition[/url]﻿ with NPCs?\n<br />A: NPCs will become friendlier with you. You will be able to sleep in their houses and take some of their possessions. NPCs might become your followers or potential spouses. You might get better prices with merchants. Some mods might confer other benefits: for example, you will be able to enter their homes by knocking with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24297]Simply Knock[/url]﻿. See [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Disposition]UESP article on disposition[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Q: Some NPCs are asking me to do ridiculous things! A blacksmith is asking me to sharpen their dagger, an alchemist is asking me to gather ingredients, and a child is asking me to rescue their Orc friend from a Draugr crypt!\n<br />A: Use your imagination! Maybe they are too busy, maybe they wanted to test your mettle﻿, maybe they just wanted to provide you with employment, or maybe they are using you to laundering money for their secret skooma cartel. Anything is possible!\n<br />\n<br />Q: Something is broken; translations\n<br />A: I am not responsible for the quality and maintenance of the translations. Please do not use outdated translations.[/quote]"
