nexusDescription="[center][color=#93c47d][size=6][b]Gourmet - A Cooking Overhaul[/b][/size][/color][/center]\n<br />\n<br />Gourmet is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s cooking system that distributes food, ingredients, and crafting tables throughout the game. In addition to thoroughly reworking cooking recipes, it also rebalances the inventories of all food vendors, including innkeepers, general merchants, grocers, butchers, and brewers. New recipe items, cookbooks, and chef merchants have also been added to the game, as well as new drinks and drugs.\n<br />[color=#ffd966]\n<br />[/color][color=#93c47d][size=5][b]Requirements[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Gourmet comes with a suite of new icons designed for use with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81409]Constructible Object Custom Keyword System[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85702]Inventory Interface Information Injector[/url]. Since the mod will still function without these icons, these mods should be considered soft requirements.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#93c47d][size=5]Food[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />In Gourmet, food provides long-lasting buffs to Health, Magicka, or Stamina Regeneration. Meats and stews provide Health Regeneration; vegetables, soups, and breads provide Stamina Regeneration; and pastries, desserts, and cheeses provide Magicka Regeneration. All food buffs last for 20 minutes by default, and the player can benefit from all three buffs at once.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d][size=4][b]Meats and Stews[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Uncooked meat grants 10% Health Regeneration. If Survival Mode is installed, these items also have a chance to give the player Food Poisoning. Cooked meat grants 25% Health Regeneration. These meals are created in a cooking pot with raw meat and salt. Stews and chowders provide 50% Health Regeneration. Meat stews are created in a cooking pot with raw meat, frost mirriam, garlic, and salt. Mushroom stews are created in a cooking pot with two mushrooms, frost mirriam, elves ear, and garlic. Chowders are created in a cooking pot with raw meat, butter, milk, and salt.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d][spoiler][b]10% Health Regeneration[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Beef\n<br />Boar Meat\n<br />Chicken\n<br />Clam Meat\n<br />Dog Meat\n<br />Goat Meat\n<br />Horker Meat\n<br />Horse Meat\n<br />Mammoth Meat\n<br />Mudcrab Legs\n<br />Pheasant\n<br />Rabbit\n<br />Salmon\n<br />Skeever Meat\n<br />Slaughterfish Meat\n<br />Venison\n<br />\n<br />[b]25% Health Regeneration:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Cooked Beef\n<br />Cooked Boar\n<br />Cooked Chicken\n<br />Cooked Dog\n<br />Cooked Goat\n<br />Horker Loaf\n<br />Cooked Horse\n<br />Mammoth Steak\n<br />Steamed Mudcrab Legs\n<br />Pheasant Roast\n<br />Rabbit Haunch\n<br />Charred Skeever\n<br />Slaughterfish Steak\n<br />Venison Chop\n<br />\n<br />[b]50% Health Regeneration[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Beef Stew\n<br />Boar Stew\n<br />Clam Chowder\n<br />Goat Stew\n<br />Horker Stew\n<br />Mammoth Stew\n<br />Pheasant Stew\n<br />Rabbit Stew\n<br />Venison Stew\n<br />Mushroom Stew\n<br />Wild Mushroom Stew\n<br />Glowing Mushroom Stew\n<br />Clam Chowder[/spoiler]\n<br />[size=4][b]Vegetables, Soups, and Breads[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Uncooked vegetables grant 10% Stamina Regeneration. These items are not considered “raw” and will not grant food Poisoning if Survival Mode is installed. Vegetable soups grant either 25% or 50% Stamina Regeneration depending on the number of ingredients they require. 25% soups are created at a cooking pot with a vegetable, a leek, and salt. 50% soups are created at a cooking pot with two vegetables, elves ear, and salt. Baked or roasted vegetables grant 25% Stamina Regeneration. They are created in a baking oven with a vegetable, butter, and salt. Bread items grant either 25% or 50% Stamina Regeneration depending on the number of ingredients they require. They are created in a baking oven with flour, butter, and salt.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d][spoiler][b]10% Stamina Regeneration[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Bread\n<br />Cabbage\n<br />Carrot\n<br />Flour\n<br />Gourd\n<br />Leek\n<br />Potato\n<br />Tomato\n<br />\n<br />[b]25% Stamina Regeneration[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Baked Potato\n<br />Bread Loaf\n<br />Cabbage Soup\n<br />Carrot Soup\n<br />Grilled Leeks\n<br />Potato Soup\n<br />Gourd Soup\n<br />Roasted Carrot\n<br />Tomato Soup\n<br />\n<br />[b]50% Stamina Regeneration\n<br />[/b]\n<br />Braided Bread\n<br />Cabbage and Potato Soup\n<br />Cabbage and Tomato Soup\n<br />Garlic Bread\n<br />Potato Bread\n<br />Vegetable Soup[/spoiler][/color]\n<br />[size=4][b][color=#93c47d][size=4][b]Pastries, Desserts, and Cheeses[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/size]Uncooked fruits and ingredients like butter, honey, and milk grant 10% Magicka Regeneration. These items are not considered “raw” and will not grant food Poisoning if Survival Mode is installed. Pastries and desserts grant either 25% or 50% Magicka Regeneration depending on the number of ingredients they require. Pastries and desserts are created in a baking oven with eggs, flour, butter, and other, similar items. Cheeses and fondues grant either 25% or 50% Magicka Regeneration depending on the item. Cheese Wheels and Cheese Bowls grant 25% Magicka Regeneration, but cannot be crafted. Fondues grant 50% Magicka Regeneration. They are created in a cooking pot with a cheese wheel, white wine, lavender, and salt.[size=4][b]\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/size][color=#93c47d][spoiler][b]10% Magicka Regeneration[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Apple\n<br />Butter\n<br />Eidar Cheese Wedge\n<br />Goat Cheese Wedge\n<br />Honey\n<br />Milk[size=4][b]\n<br />[/b][/size]\n<br />[b]25% Magicka Regeneration[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Apple Dumpling\n<br />Boiled Creme Treat\n<br />Eidar Cheese Wheel\n<br />Goat Cheese Wheel\n<br />Honey Nut Treat\n<br />Jazbay Dumpling\n<br />Juniper Dumpling\n<br />Long Taffy Treat\n<br />Mammoth Cheese Bowl\n<br />Sliced Eidar Cheese Wheel\n<br />Sliced Goat Cheese Wheel\n<br />Snowberry Dumpling\n<br />Sweet Roll\n<br />\n<br />[b]50% Magicka Regeneration\n<br />[/b]\n<br />Apple Pie\n<br />Eidar Cheese Fondue\n<br />Goat Cheese Fondue\n<br />Jazbay Crostata\n<br />Juniper Crostata\n<br />Mammoth Cheese Fondue\n<br />Snowberry Crostata[/spoiler]\n<br />[size=4][b]Homecooked Meal[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Cooking is an act of love, and there’s no meal quite as filling as a meal cooked by a lover. The Homecooked Meal is Gourmet’s only “superfood.” It increases your Health, Magicka, and Stamina Regeneration by 50%. You can only receive one Homecooked Meal per day.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#93c47d][size=4]Recipes[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />In Gourmet, most foods require a recipe. You know the recipes for cooked meat (Meat + Salt Pile) by default, and you can craft 25% Health Regeneration foods without purchasing a recipe if you have the relevant meat in your inventory. Recipes for 25% Magicka and Stamina foods are very inexpensive (50-60 gold), while recipes for 50% foods are slightly more expensive (150-175 gold). Recipes can be purchased at general stores, butchers, grocers, and chefs. Recipes for food items which require a cooking pot are labeled as “Cooking Recipes.” Recipes for food items which require a baking oven are labeled as “Baking Recipes.” \n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#93c47d][size=4]Cooking Pots and Baking Ovens[/size][/color]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />Gourmet comes with an optional ESL'd plugin that distributes cooking pots and baking ovens throughout the world. Cooking pots have been added to Braidwood Inn, Dead Man's Drink, Four Shields Tavern, Frostfruit Inn, Moorside Inn, Nightgate Inn, Old Hroldan Inn, Sleeping Giant Inn, The Frozen Hearth, The Winking Skeever, Vilemyr Inn, and Windpeak Inn. Baking ovens have been added to The Winking Skeever, The Silver-Blood Inn, The Bannered Mare, The Bee and Barb, and The Retching Netch.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d][size=4][b]Vendors[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Gourmet significantly improves food vendors throughout Skyrim. Innkeepers will sell cooked foods (both 25% and 50% foods), as well as common and rare alcohols. General Stores will sell cooking ingredients, spices, vegetables, fruits, raw meats, and a few recipes. Grocers will sell a larger number of cooking ingredients, spices, vegetables, and fruits, as well as a larger number of cooked foods and recipes. Butchers will sell a larger number of meat-related cooking ingredients, spices, and raw meats, as well as a larger number of cooked meats, stews, and recipes. A limited number of DLC Vendors will sell Dunmer-themed foods generally only found on Solstheim.\n<br />\n<br />Gourmet also adds a new vendor type to the game by converting three chef NPCs into merchants. Those NPCs are: Anton Virane, Bendt, and Odar. Each chef sells a large amount of food and alcohol, as well as a comprehensive selection of recipes and a special cookbook which you can purchase to increase your cooking skill.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d][Spoiler][b]Markarth:[/b] Hogni Red-Arm (Butcher), Anton Virane (Chef)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Riften:[/b] Marise Aravel (Grocer and Butcher), Brand-Shei (DLC Vendor)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Solitude:[/b] Jala (Grocer), Evette San (Brewer), Addvar (Fishmonger), Bendt (Chef), Odar (Chef)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Whiterun:[/b] Carlotta Valentia (Grocer), Anoriath (Butcher)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Windhelm: [/b]Hillevi Cruel-Sea (Grocer), Aval Atheron (Butcher), Ambarys Rendar (DLC Vendor)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Raven Rock: [/b]Garyn Ienth (Grocer)\n<br />\n<br />[b]Skaal Village:[/b] Edla (Grocer)[/spoiler]\n<br />[/color][color=#93c47d][size=4][b]Cookbooks[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />There are three cookbooks which can be purchased in order to permanently improve the effects of food. These cookbooks are sold by Chef vendors in Understone Keep, the Blue Palace, and the Bards College for a hefty sum. Their bonuses stack additively.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d][spoiler][b]The Art of Cooking, Vol. 1:[/b] Permanently increases the duration of all food effects by 100%.\n<br />\n<br />[b]The Art of Cooking, Vol 2:[/b]  Permanently increases the duration of all food effects by 100%.\n<br />[b]\n<br />The Art of Cooking, Vol 3: [/b]You create twice as many food items from the same number of ingredients.[/spoiler][/color]\n<br />In addition, rumor has it that the Gourmet is working on a sequel to Uncommon Taste which is sure to be a hit… as long as he doesn’t get murdered by some random asshole before he has a chance to publish it. If he does, in fact, get murdered by some random asshole, then the secrets of the Gourmet could be lost to Tamriel forever.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=5][b]Alcohol[/b]\n<br />[/size][/color]\n<br />In Gourmet, alcohol provides a long-lasting buff to either Stamina or Magicka, in exchange for an equal debuff to the opposite stat. Ales and meads increase Stamina in exchange for reducing Magicka; wines and brandies increase Magicka in exchange for reducing Stamina. Alcohol comes in two tiers, common and rare. Common alcohol increases one stat (and reduces the other) by 25. Rare alcohol increases one stat (and reduces the other) by 50. All alcohol buffs last for ten minutes.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][Spoiler][b]+25 Stamina / -25 Magicka Drinks[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Ale\n<br />Mead\n<br />Honningbrew Mead\n<br />Black-Briar Mead\n<br />\n<br />[b]+50 Stamina / -50 Magicka Drinks[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Honningbrew Limited\n<br />Black-Briar Reserve\n<br />Red Eagle's Rye\n<br />Wrothgarian Rum\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]+25 Magicka / -25 Stamina Drinks[/b]\n<br />\n<br />White Wine\n<br />Red Wine\n<br />Fruit Wine\n<br />Alto Wine\n<br />\n<br />[b]+50 Magicka / -50 Stamina Drinks[/b]\n<br />\n<br />Argonian Bloodwine\n<br />Surilie Brothers Wine\n<br />Colovian Brandy[b][/spoiler][/b][/color]\n<br />[b][color=#ffd966][size=4]Special Edition Bottles[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />There are two special alcohol bottles which can be purchased in order to permanently improve the effects of alcohol. These bottles are sold by the Black-Briar and Honningbrew Meaderies for a hefty sum. Their bonuses stack additively.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][Spoiler][b]Black-Briar Special: [/b]Permanently increases the duration of all alcohol effects by 50%.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Honningbrew Special: [/b]Permanently increases the duration of all alcohol effects by 50%.[/spoiler][/color]\n<br />[color=#8e7cc3][size=5][b]Drugs \n<br />[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />Gourmet also makes several changes to drug items. The three main drugs in Skyrim are Sleeping Tree Sap, Skooma, and a new drug called Eversnow. These drug items can be purchased from caravan merchants and Thieves Guild fences throughout Skyrim. Several other drug items have been edited for consistency, but these items are generally quest-related and are not distributed throughout Skyrim.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#8e7cc3][spoiler][b]Sleeping Tree Sap: [/b]Your Health is increased by 100, and your Health Regeneration is increased by 100%. However, your Stamina and Magicka are reduced by 50.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Skooma: [/b]Your Stamina is increased by 100, and your Stamina Regeneration is increased by 100%. However, your Health and Magicka are reduced by 50.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Eversnow: [/b]Your Magicka is increased by 100, and you Magicka Regeneration is increased by 100%. However, your Health and Stamina are reduced by 50.[/spoiler][/color]\n<br />[b][color=#8e7cc3][size=4]Addiction\n<br />[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />When consuming a drug item, the player has a 25% chance to develop an addiction. A Minor Addiction lasts for 24 hours before disappearing on its own. It is not a disease, and it cannot be removed with a Cure Disease effect. If the player consumes another drug item while under the effects of a Minor Addiction, the 24 hour timer on their Minor Addiction will be reset, and they also have a 25% chance to develop a Major Addiction. A Major Addiction lasts for 24 hours before progressing to a Minor Addiction. If the player consumes another drug item while under the effects of a Major Addiction, the 24 hour timer on their Major Addiction will be reset, and they also have a 25% chance to develop a Severe Addiction. A Severe Addiction lasts for 24 hours before progressing to a Minor Addiction. Consuming a drug item temporarily suppresses the debuffs associated with addiction.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#8e7cc3][spoiler][b]Minor Addiction:[/b] Your Magicka and Stamina regenerate 25% slower.*\n<br />\n<br />[b]Major Addiction:[/b] Your Magicka and Stamina regenerate 50% slower.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Severe Addiction: [/b]Your Magicka and Stamina regenerate 100% slower.\n<br />\n<br />*Addiction effects target your [b]base [/b]regeneration rate.[/spoiler]\n<br />[/color][color=#93c47d][size=5][b]Vampires\n<br />[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />Becoming a Vampire has a negative effect on your ability to benefit from food. Food buffs are roughly 50% weaker for Vampires (in actuality, food buffs are reduced by a single \"tier,\" meaning that 25% foods become 10% foods, a 60% reduction). This debuff will be reflected in the player's active effects.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d][spoiler][b]Profane Hunger: [/b]As a Vampire, your food bonuses are less effective.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Predator's Hunger: [/b]As a Werewolf, your food bonuses last half as long.[/spoiler][/color]\n<br />[color=#93c47d][size=5][b]Survival Mode\n<br />[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />Gourmet comes with robust Survival Mode integration, including distribution for hot foods, new hot food recipes, and buffs to the hot foods themselves. It also makes changes to the distribution of Restore Hunger effects. These changes are designed to cohere with the gameplay that Gourmet creates. Changes include:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Alcohol no longer restores hunger.\n<br />[*]Hot Soups (soups, specifically) no longer exist.\n<br />[*]Several new Hot Stews have been added.\n<br />[*]At least one Hot Stew will be sold by every food vendor.\n<br />[*]Hot Stews increase your Warmth by 50 instead of 25.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />All of these changes, including recipe distribution, will only occur when Survival Mode is activated. Note that any leveled-item-based Survival Mode distribution will not take effect until vendors reset after Survival Mode has been activated.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d][size=5][b]Compatibility\n<br />[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />Gourmet is a robust, gameplay-oriented overhaul of Skyrim's food mechanics. One of the major barriers to improving Skyrim's food mechanics is that Skyrim's food [i]vendors[/i] are poorly designed and poorly stocked. Because of this, Gourmet makes significant edits to a large number of merchant chests. Fortunately, container edits are extremely easy to patch, and they can often be patched automatically. Users should be careful to check Gourmet for conflicts in their load order. You can find pregenerated patches for Gourmet on the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97050]Gourmet Patch Page[/url].\n<br />\n<br />I do not recommend combining this mod with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84875]Cooking Categories Improvement[/url], as Gourmet has its own implementation of food sorting that comes with new icons.\n<br />\n<br />This should be obvious, but it needs to be said anyway: Gourmet is [b]not compatible[/b] with the old Apothecary - Food and Drink Addon.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#93c47d][size=5][b]The Simonrim Team[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Simon Magus ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746?tab=user+files]Nexus[/url]﻿ / [url=https://www.patreon.com/simonmagus]Patreon[/url]﻿﻿)\n<br />DeltaRider[b] [/b]([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3222307?tab=user+files]Nexus[/url]﻿ / [url=https://www.patreon.com/Delta011]Patreon[/url]﻿)\n<br />Oreo ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/56683512?tab=user+files]Nexus[/url]﻿﻿ / [url=https://www.patreon.com/Oreo2583]Patreon[/url])\n<br />Colinswrath ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6850662?tab=user+files]Nexus[/url]﻿ / [url=http://patreon.com/colinswrath]Patreon[/url]﻿)\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b][color=#93c47d]The Simonrim Suite[/color]\n<br />[/b][/size][b][size=2][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686]\n<br />[/url][/size][/b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686]Aetherius - A Race Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411]Mundus - A Standing Stone Overhaul[/url]﻿\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839]Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul[/url]﻿\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191]Adamant - A Perk Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790]Hand to Hand - An Adamant Addon[/url]﻿[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33487]\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549]Blade and Blunt - A Combat Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33487]Arena - An Encounter Zone Overhaul[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41639]Scion - A Vampire Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44746]Manbeast - A Werewolf Overhaul[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790]\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90659]Stormcrown - A Shout Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099]Pilgrim - A Religion Overhaul[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099]\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138]Thaumaturgy - An Enchanting Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99619]Artificer - An Artifact Overhaul[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95196]Sorcerer - A Staff and Scroll Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130]Apothecary - An Alchemy Overhaul\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96876]Gourmet - A Cooking Overhaul[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92220]Journeyman - A Fast Travel Overhaul\n<br />[/url]﻿[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97542]Candlehearth - An Inn Overhaul\n<br />[/url]﻿[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97536]Starfrost - A Survival Overhaul[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92220]\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55114][b][color=#93c47d][size=5]Jelidity's Other Mods[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56123]CoMAP - Common Marker Extension Project[/url] \n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59460]Functional Fearsome Fists\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51529]Amber Refossilised \n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41348]Stalhrim Refrozen[/url]"
