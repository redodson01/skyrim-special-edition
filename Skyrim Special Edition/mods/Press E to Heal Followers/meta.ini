Stop destroying every ecosystem we land in!\" I thought to myself, while I was on my way to heal her. Then the thought came to me: [i]This is quite handy. Wouldn't it be cool to heal followers the same way in Skyrim?[/i]\n<br />\n<br />And here we are.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Requirements:\n<br />[/b]- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96273]Dynamic Key Activation\n<br />\n<br />[/url][b]Patch available for:\n<br />[/b]- [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95489?tab=description]NPC Stuck in Bleedout Fix\n<br />[/url]\n<br />[b]The Basics:\n<br />[/b]- Press E on a kneeling follower. A health potion from your inventory will be automatically given to the follower and they will attempt to stand up and continue fighting. Your follower will say a custom fitting dialogue line thanking you or commenting on the situation.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][b][size=5]-Video Showcase-\n<br />[/size][/b][youtube]uCmm5gUqMjg[/youtube][/center]\n<br />[size=3][b]Full Features Explained:\n<br />[/b]- When you hover the cursor over a downed follower, the activation text will change to \"Heal\".\n<br />- Pressing E (or your activate key/button) will give them a healing potion from your inventory.\n<br />- The lowest tier potions are chosen first for this, so you don't go \"wasting\" the best potions on healing followers.\n<br />- Your follower will actually thank you / say something relevant afterwards. [u]There are close to 200 \"smart\" dialogue lines for this[/u], and they range from thanking you, commenting on the outcome of the battle, saying they're sorry they let you down and more.[i] Immersion!\n<br />[/i]- If your follower is down and you need to talk to them, but you can't or don't want to heal them, you can still do the vanilla activation by pressing SHIFT + activating them (thanks to Dynamic Activation Key)\n<br />- If you want to heal someone who is kneeling but is NOT a follower and NOT an enemy, you can do it by pressing SHIFT + E. So basically the opposite of followers. The action with most priority takes precedence: For random NPCs in bleedout, the default action is the default vanilla activation, for followers, the default activation while they're done is to heal them. Pressing SHIFT brings the alternate action up.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Thanks:\n<br />[/b]- I [url=https://media1.giphy.com/media/l44QjgeQ5ium91n9K/giphy.gif]looked for inspiration[/url] in wskeever's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42402]Smart Optimal Salves[/url]. Great mod that allows you to use H/S/M potions on the fly.\n<br />- The idea came from me playing Starfield, but I was also [url=https://i.gifer.com/1g6M.gif]inspired[/url] by Andrealphus' [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24127]Administer Potions to Friendly NPCs[/url]. Great mod![/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/a8rBn2p.png[/img]\n<br /> \n<br />[size=5]〜Ares, Eric, FluffPantsMysterious,\n<br />Macpherb, Nightfallstorm, Panda, Sir Trooper〜\n<br />[/size][size=2]&amp; everyone who is supporting me on Patreon or via other means\n<br />Thank you! Your support means a lot![/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[center]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/0DhnyTT.png[/img]\n<br />[size=3]\n<br />[/size][/center][size=3][b]\n<br />- ESL flagged? Safe to install mid-game?\n<br />[/b]Yes, mortal. The dremoras wouldn't have it any other way. Oh wait, wrong mod. But the answer is still yes.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Performance?\n<br />[/b]Completely safe. A script fragment runs for half a second after you activate a bleeding follower and that's it. \n<br />\n<br />[b]- Will custom followers use the new lines?\n<br />[/b]If they use one of the vanilla voices, yes. Otherwise, no, but this doesn't affect the mod. They will get a potion just like normal.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- I need to talk/activate the NPC while they're \"downed\". How can I do this?\n<br />[/b]You can disable the healing functionality for followers by pressing SHIFT (Thanks to DAK). That will give you the default activation.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- I want to be able to choose the potion I give to my follower. Is this possible?\n<br />[/b]By default, this happens automatically and it's quick and beautiful. Done in a similar way to the implementation in Starfield. However, if you want to CHOOSE which potion to give to your follower, you can type this in the console \"Set HealFollowers_Quick to 0\"\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Is this compatible with \"Administer Potions to Friendly NPCs\"?\n<br />[/b]Yes, but they're sort of similar. The DAK patch for Administer Potions is incompatible with \"Press E to Heal\", as the DAK patch already allows you to open the \"Administer Potion\" menu at any time with your followers, including when they're down. So in short: Yes it's compatible, but do not use the DAK patch. Secret tip: There's also an[i] [/i]addon for Administer Potions that adds the potion functionality as a dialogue option with followers, instead of having an ability. (Available [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97490?tab=files]here[/url]: again, do not install this together with the DAK patch for Administer Potions).\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Is this compatible with some mod that adds a \"[i]knockout instead of bleedout\" [/i]mechanic?\n<br />[/b]I don't think so. I imagine the NPC needs to be awake to drink the potion and say the line. But no idea, I haven't tested it.\n<br />[/size][center]\n<br />_________\n<br />\n<br />This mod is included in...\n<br />[url=https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/qdurkx?_gl=1*eyool0*_ga*MTAyMTU2NjkxNi4xNjYxMzUxODAx*_ga_N0TELNQ37M*MTY5Mzc0MDgzNC4yODI3LjEuMTY5Mzc1MTMxOS4wLjAuMA..][img]https://i.imgur.com/YfgAA8V.png[/img][/url]\n<br />﻿?️ A Dynamic World - ? Roleplaying - ?
