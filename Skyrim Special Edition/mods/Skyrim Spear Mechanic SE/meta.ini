nexusDescription="[size=4][b]About[/b][/size]\n<br />This mod adds spear/javelin weapons and the animation to go with it. These are of the sword type and\n<br /> uses the one-handed perk tree. Both the player and NPCs can use the \n<br />spears along with animations. The spears can be crafted and can be found\n<br /> on bandits you encounter. \n<br />\n<br />Update: As of now and future releases will not support FNIS/Nemesis and will instead be utilizing DAR \n<br />(Dynamic Animation Replacer)\n<br />[i]\n<br />Skyrim LE version[/i]: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/97220]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/97220[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Spear Grip Mechanic[/u][/b]: When using the spear with a shield or off-hand weapon the one-handed animation will be used. If the \n<br />left hand is unequipped and empty then both hands will grip the spear \n<br />and the two-handed animation will be used. While in this pseudo \n<br />two-handed mode you gain an attack damage boost of a fixed 1 point. \n<br />Using magic on the left hand is considered empty, both hands grip the \n<br />spear until you cast a spell.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Javelin Throw[/b][/u]: Blockbash and power blockbash will throw the javelin. Javelin damage is \n<br />the base damage x2.5 ignoring armor and can stagger the foe.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Custom Skeleton[/u][/b]: This mod uses a custom skeleton to enable sheathing the spear/javelin \n<br />to the back. If you use a different mod that includes a skeleton then \n<br />this mod's skeleton will not be used. So if you use XPMSE then my \n<br />skeleton will be ignored and the game should resume with XPMSE as \n<br />normal.\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]Bsr2ra_6rp4[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Uninstall[/b][/size]\n<br />- Remove the mod, load up the game and save.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Install[/b][/size]\n<br />- Uninstall any older versions first.\n<br />- Install like normal, load the game and play. Wait a few sec for DAR to cache, have fun.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]How it works[/b][/size]\n<br />- DAR replaces animations based on conditions such as detecting an \n<br />equipped weapon and many more. All added animations are interchangeable \n<br />and all vanilla animations are still available. This applies to both \n<br />Player and NPC.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Requirements[/b][/size]\n<br />SKSE\n<br />DAR\n<br />NIOverride\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Compatibility\n<br />[/size][/b]- Fully compatible with Animated Armoury by NickNak\n<br />- May work alongside other spear animation mods without conflicts. Only spears from this mod will use this mod's animations.\n<br />- May conflict with other animation mods that does the same thing.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Spear Stats[/b][/size]\n<br />All spear length and attack speed are now uniformed.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Credits[/b][/size]\n<br />BouBoule201288 - Inspirations for my mod.\n<br />NickaNak - Being the best mentor ever!\n<br />Bubbajones_ya - For the Blender setup, none of my animations could have been made without this.\n<br />KeyboardKing - Tester\n<br />ï»¿nikikuriton - Original author of the Elder Spear"
