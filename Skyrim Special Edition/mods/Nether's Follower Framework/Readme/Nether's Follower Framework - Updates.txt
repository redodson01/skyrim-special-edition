+ -- NETHER'S FOLLOWER FRAMEWORK -- +

- Update 2.8.6b

Installer/System:
- Misty Skye support removed by mod author by request per it's ability to affect/create outfits. The MA feels that some features of NFF may interfere with Misty's mechanics in such a way that it causes (actual or potential) issues with the character. Further, as some users have cited NFF as to what they have decided to be a probable cause in difficulties with Misty's new quest content, I concur that the best course of action is to completely eliminate direct support with NFF. Misty and Summer (for consistency) can no longer be imported into NFF or use it's features. This may be revisited at a future date, but it's best to exclude the mod at this time, which also gives the MA the ability to handle current issues without NFF being cited as a contributing factor.
- Follow up to above, it's best that you remove Misty from the framework before installing this update. However, you should be able to remove her per the Slots page by clicking on her name.
- "No Import" faction is now considered when using the Command Followers power.
- Mod authors may place their followers or actors in the nwsFF_NoImport faction (Record ID: 005C4445) if they wish to patch against NFF using them. I generally believe that it's up to users to make common sense decisions for themselves, so I will not be taking down NFF to make alterations unless I had specifically targeted certain followers already that I feel are enjoyable and fun to use.

MCM:
- Toggling on/off Allow Sparring unlocks (or disables) the options correctly without having to leave and return to the page.

System:
- Slight tweak to History on game load that is intended to remove dead or uninstalled followers from the current game, to hopefully catch a bit better.


- Update 2.8.6

Home Bases:
- Speed of tab and functions greatly improved.
- Removed old upgrade function (10 to 20 bases) for very old versions of NFF updating to the new one.
- Follower is now cleared from home base if they die.
- Code optimization.

Candlelight:
- Candelight casting no longer bugs out on fast travel or cell changing. Thanks to megaman2k for the heads up and investigation.

Settings:
- Command Followers Power is no longer assigned to the player by default, allowing you to choose to use the power or the hotkey.
- Command Followers, Calm and Retreat Powers are now saved into configuration and loaded from configuration.

MCM:
- Shows in the MCM list of mods as "NFF" instead of "Follower Framework". Does NOT update in a current game.
- For translations, added string: $FF_ModName	NFF

Installer:
- Source Script installation is now an option and you can install into the LE or SSE folder structure.

System:
- Followers are no longer removed from game factions. Instead they are set to -1 if not in a faction. There is almost always no in-game difference but is the proper way.


- Update 2.8.5

Fixes:
- Dialogue restriction to Elope now applies to children and animals. Command Followers menu added animal restriction. Was missed when making the dialogue more universal. You'll have to use your best judgment of who else not to elope with.
- The following settings will be applied at game load (not baked into save): Multi-Sandboxing, No Weapon Draw, Bump Reaction times, Bleedout Rate, Custom Difficulty and Hire Costs.
- Removed QueueNiNodeUpdate() call from followers when using stealth features. This should resolve issues with other mods that don't like head redraw.
- Player chest opening cooldowns should now be removed if using the hotkey or Command Followers menu.

Changes:
- Followers now use catch-up (teleport) if they are not in combat, even if the player is. This should allow lost followers to catch up to a player in combat or that has moved to a combat situation.
- Added combat package to the stack that might help followers blocking the player during combat.
- You can also move stubborn
- Also implemented another way to move stubborn followers. In combat, the 3rd friendly hit in a row from the player will teleport that follower behind you.

- Update 2.8.4b

Outfit Preview Mode:
- Fixed a bug where outfit creation or removal might accidentally select the last follower you made an outfit for, not the current one. This had a side effect of disabling ai processing on the wrong actor. This fix corrects one script only.
- If you have a follower that is turned to stone (will not move) due to this bug, open console, select them, type: tai.

Sparring:
- Made a couple of changes to sparring where followers and npcs should be much more likely to fight each other.
- Restored Countdown voice.

Elope:
- When using Elope from the Command Followers Power, the npc no longer needs to be in the crosshair.
- Via dialogue, Elope now works with any unique npc. Use caution, this will automatically set marriage faction and such for the npc and it is NOT recommended to Elope with an npc that has their own romance or marriage system.

Startup:
- Added a failsafe in the event that a subsystem gets stuck during startup. You should now get the startup and complete messages at all times and the complete message within 5 seconds.
- If you are not receiving NFF startup and complete messages and you don't have them turned off, install the option text file in Miscellaneous and in game console type: bat freeNFF. After saving, on next game load things should return to normal.

MCM UI Fixes:
- Copy Outfit, under Follower Outfit & Gear is now a text button instead of a toggle.
- Show Outfit Dialogue, under Follower Outfit & Gear is no longer greyed out if the follower is unique and not an animal.
- Divorce Spouse, under Interaction, now toggles correctly.
- If Clothing Stripped, under Activity, is toggled off (default), then Ripping Sounds is disabled.

Initial Settings:
- Gift Interval, under Gameplay, is not set to 14 days by default.
- Allow Skill Affinity is now on by default.
- Ask to Teleport Waiting Followers is enabled by default.

Misc:
- Stop time in menus setting and effect is now removed due to possible bug for some users.


- Update 2.8.3

Outfit Preview Mode:
-  Fixed an issue where changing the items in an outfit and using preview mode could cause the game to freeze. Intermittent issue, so was not happening in all cases.
- Creating or Change an outfit now turns off actor AI processing so that they don't wander around right before making it.

Favorites:
- You can now set/remove/change a home base for a follower through the Favorites menu when selecting a specific actor.

History:
- History count (sequence) and names now update upon loading a save. The sequence should show correct numbering in the MCM and if the Actor's name has changed, should be reflected (for example "Strange Girl" to "M'rissi").

Misc:
- Suppressed load order position warning message for now due to false positives, potentially from a mix of esl and esp mods, where most of them might be esl.

- Update 2.8.2

Hearthfires Notice:
- Added Hearthfires as master. Nearly everyone should have this master active, especially on SSE/AE. This fixes an issue with those that are asking their kid to tag along on adventures. Should also technically support multiple adoptions.

Game Slot Notice:
- Now when using the game slot, the game's player follower count is set to 1.0. This will prevent ANY followers from being recruited while a follower is in the game slot. This was done for compatibility with blades without dialogue changes. Removing a follower from the game slot (either by using the slots page or the follower is dismissed) will set the game count to normal (only sets to 1.0 if 10 followers are being used). Keep in mind that you should only use the game slot if needed - saving a game with a follower in the game slot and loading that game is likely to kick the follower completely due to how NFF initializes.

Fixes:
- Weapons should now unequip properly if a follower asked to wait.
- Fixed an issue where the game slot wasn't being filled if you've placed a follower in this slot for purposes of Blade recruitement, marrying and the like. Fixed an issue where swapping with a follower already in the game slot wasn't functioning. This is an outstanding issue from a few versions back.
- Command Followers power should now perform actions on a single follower properly in regards to follow/wait/dismiss commands.
- Fixed a potential issue where the worker threads during startup could get hung, possibly due to papyrus tweaks. After installing 2.8.2, you may get the startup complete message twice as Skyrim may have tried to bake the save. Just save your game, exit and load your save and it should be fine.
- Fixed an index error in the Command Followers power, having to do with follower scaling.

Teammate Healing:
- Followers in NFF's healer role can now occasionally heal player teammates that aren't followers. This is the lowest priority after: The player, the caster, other followers (in that order). Target must be within 512 units to be healed and is randomly detected (not 100% precise).

Import (MCM):
- You can now toggle between allowing a follower to be imported by dialogue via NFF or not. This setting is found under the system page when a valid follower is under the game's crosshair. This does not affect standard followers or expendable recruits. The follower must currently be a player's teammate.

New Favorites Features (via Command Followers):
- In the individual Favorites menus, you can now recruit all followers in your created favorite. The favorite followers will be teleported to you and added, in order, to the current roster. Followers will not be added once reaching the maximum follower count of 10. Only standard followers can be affected (no import followers).
- In the individual Favorites menus, you can now swap out existing followers for all followers in your created favorite. The favorite followers will be teleported to you and added, in order, to the current roster. Followers will not be added once reaching the maximum follower count of 10. Only standard followers can be affected (no import followers). Formerly current followers will be dismissed and sent to their home base, if they have one.
- These two additions should allow you to set up small squads of followers that you can swap in and out or add to the current pool. Also, if you've been just making followers wait to easily acquire them, this might be an alternative for you.


- Update 2.8.1

- Fixed hide helmet removes chest/body armor issue.
- Wigs should not be detected as helmets in most cases.
- SPID files now use tilde characters instead of dashes.
- AttackDamageMult is not longer erroneously set to 100.0 upon actor removal.
- Player now has an onhit event for passing information to followers (hey, the player is hit, do something!). On a 5 second cooldown (state) and it's really only needed prior to followers entering combat.
- Followers should be far less likely to be stuck in a crouch position when player stands up after crounching and improved stealth ai is in use.
- Improved stealth ai should be more receptive to player being hit and followers being hit. Should improve on any bugs happening here.
- Extinguish Torches should be working consistently again. Sending evaluate package on improved stealth package end.
- Optimization and clean up of follower alias script code.
- There may be some outfit issues that have not yet been narrowed down but I felt it was important to address the issues above.

- Update 2.8.0

Fixes:
- Actor references for bonus companions (Ysolda, Thieves Guild Members, etc) are no longer flagged as persistent. Instead uses a formlist method.
- Moved some NFF-based references to NFF's holding cell.
- Reworked history system to be more efficient and to resolve an issue with history causing an error with Command Followers menu, causing it to not load. History will get cleared if updating in a currently running game, however you can save any followers as favorites prior to updating. As a caveat, History max is now 200, up from 100.
- Followers should no longer engage when player is in a brawl. This might not affect imported followers that may have their own scripts running that defend the player.
- Removed a bug related to sorting followers.
- Enhanced Stealth no longer applies an in-game invisible effect. You still get the benefits, however.
- Sparring set to off by default.
- Silent Lines should no longer move follower's mouth. There are still some unvoiced lines.
- Removed Player Chest cooldowns.
- Fixed a bug with the Friendly Fire perk. Previously, if using SPID to distribute it to followers, could cause some some spells to have 0 Magnitude. This has been corrected.
- Added OnObjectEquipped, OnObjectUnequipped to states for flood control.
- Unequip Weapons no longer unequips shields.
- Fixed an issue where home base residents lists weren't refreshed when adding a follower to a base through the Command Followers power.

Combat:
- Combat Awareness can now be triggered if the player is considered by the game to be in combat but the followers aren't. A magic effect on the player will ping the followers if player is in combat and they are not. Followers will try to detect an enemy near the player then try to detect an enemy near themselves (about 1600 units indoors, 3200 outdoors). This should help to make followers more responsive if you want them to be more aggressive regarding enemies that haven't directly been engaged.
- You can now set a base Damage Multiplier for any recruited, imported or hired follower, called the Dynamic Damage Multiplier. You can also toggle any individual follower to have a Fixed Damage Multiplier, meaning they always use their individually set value. This can be setup in the MCM and the Dynamic Damage Multiplier can be quickly changed using the Command Followers power.

Outfits and Appearance:
- Currently going to limit the outfits to 128 until I can fix a bug involving having more outfits than 128 defined for followers. In a lapse of logic, I hit a formlists limit without properly allowing 200 outfits to actually be assigned.
- Creating an outfit now sets a follower's sleep outfit, if any, to a blank outfit. This was causing tunics to be generated by the game but only on npcs with sleep outfits defined so I never saw it personally.
- Added global option, Outfit Preview Mode, which allows you to preview an outfit, as if you were trading with a follower.
- A home location that is set in the MCM for outfit purposes now works outdoors. A player home must still be indoors, though you can separately set an exterior for a standalone player home, such as Tudra Homestead.
- Added Option "Weapons only in Combat (All)" to set all current followers to only show their weapons when unsheathed. Found under Inventory in the Command Followers power.
- Added Option "Shield only in Combat (All)" to set all current followers to only show their shield when in combat. Found under Inventory in the Command Followers power.

Elope:
- You can now marry multiple NPCs by eloping with them. You only receive store and meal benefits from your first spouse. However, you can receive the Lover's Comfort buff from any of your spouses.
- When forcing the ability to marry an NPC and their game relationship rank with the player is less than 1, it is set to 1. There is hard limit of 200 spouses.
- Fixed an issue where elope dialogue would not appear when speaking with an eligible NPC.

MCM:
- Corrected an issue where Autobox in Exterior would not be selectable.
- MCM script optimizations (ongoing).

Misc:
- If autoboxing is enabled and there is a custom location defined that is outside, followers will always autobox in that location, even if Autobox in Exterior is disabled.


- Update 2.7.9

Fixes:
- Corrected a couple of language file issues (2.7.8)
- Several missed settings are now recorded and loaded when using save or load settings.

Tweaks:
- Combat Awareness - Should be more accurate/aggressive at finding enemies in the area.
- Optimization of some called functions.
- Optimized reading settings from saved file.
- You can now move followers and teammates behind you if you have your weapon drawn, are not in combat and trying to move into them. This should help with followers cluttering hallways and stairways. You may have to actively move into them for a full second before they will move behind you.


UPDATES LIST:

- Update 2.7.8

Fixes:
- No Player Damage to Teammates and Unrelenting Force settings should now work properly.
- Fixed a bug where setting a follower to ignore the outfit system might make them naked.
- Home Bases Quest reduced from Priority 100 to Priority 98 to facilitate other mods.
- Fixed a long standing issue with non-English versions of Skyrim where some dialogues would not open due to using "SharedSilence", which apparently is localized.

Combat Style Changes:
- Archer, Berserker, Defender, Mercenary, Ranger Magic/Staff weights reduced to 0.0. Use Spellsword and Arcane Archer and War Priest if you want to allow magic and staff use.
- Added Arcane Archer CS. This is identical to Archer but with 5.0 weights to staff and magic.
- Added Warpriest CS. This is identical to Defender but with 5.0 weights to staff and magic.

Follower Command Menu:
- You can now set an npc as a follower or marriage/elope partner via casting the Command Follower Power on a non-follower. This is the same as the System tab feature but without requiring you to go in and out of the MCM. It does not turn "anyone" into a follower, only game (or RDO) supported voices.

- Update 2.7.7

IMPORTANT: Changes, Auto-Import
- The Auto-import feature is now disabled for followers and for Serana due to several issues in its current state. It is marked depreciated right now and may be removed or reinstated at a future date.
- Before applying this update, try to not have Serana in your party. Sometimes the game will make here a teammate anyways and if that is occuring, don't worry about trying to remove her.
- If you have Serana in your party when applying this update, allow the update to complete (she will be exported), save your game and load your saved game. At that point, auto-import features will be disengaged.
- If Import and Export dialogue options will be reset and visible when talking to a follower, if you previously had auto-import enabled for (non-Serana) followers.

Fixes, Taunt
- Taunt detection mechanism is changed due to false negatives causing a tank mode follower not to taunt. A small quest is now run that tries to fill at least 2 enemy aliases - if that happens, taunt is allowed.

Fixes, General
- Significantly moved sandboxing marker away from the player to lessen crowding on the player. Player must move twice as far as previously to update marker position. The marker is what followers sandbox around.
- Re-fixed eye glitch when using Enhanced Stealth. This can cause issues with wigs on some followers but it fixes other followers. Unfortunately, you will need to choose to use Enhanced Stealth or not depending on your needs. We can't do both "fix eyes" and "not affect temporarily modified parts". Enhanced Stealth will now be off by default (doesn't affect current game).
- Cleaned up messages when recruiting and dimissing followers.
- (Tweak) When first creating an outfit, the follower is not stripped ahead of time.
- Added voiced support for Karliah.

Fixes, MCM
- Ask to Teleport Waiting Followers greys out when Allow Teleport is unchecked.
- Labelled Show Outfit Dialogue (General).
- Show Outfit Dialogue is now enabled if the actor is unique.
- When first making a Home Base location, going back into the MCM should allow you to create Work and Relax locations.

Feature, Sparring
- Sparring system re-introduced to NFF. This is rebuilt from scratch and has some notable features and changes.
- You can ask any two current followers or potential followers to spar with each other. This excludes importable followers, except Serana.
- First follower you ask designates them as the first combatant. You can then ask a different follower to be the second combatant or switch the first combatant to a different follower.
- Once you have two followers chosen, they will try to create some distance between each other and a countdown will start (5 seconds). There is an disembodied announcer.
- The combatants will fight until 1 is dropped to 0 health.
- Once sparring is complete, those followers will have their health fully restored.
- The player can cancel a running sparring event at any time by crouching or activating (talking to) one of the combatants.
- There are options in the MCM to allow any unique NPCs (even non-followers) to spar, to turn off announcer sound, make them brave during a fight and so on.
- There is an additional feature that adds the "clothing gets torn off" trope when sparring.
- Only unique NPCs and those NOT flagged as child can fight.
- If combatants lose line of sight of each other for too long, the fight may end as a tie.
- This is a "just for fun" type feature that is useful for determining strengths of your followers or purely for entertainment purposes. There are situations where a free-for-all can occur if you have two NPCs fight that have allies nearby, so exercise caution with this feature and use common sense.
- It is 100% a good idea to save your game before engaging in sparring, especially in populated areas.

- Update 2.7.6

Fixes, Auto-Import/Export
- Add condition to exclude NFF hirelings faction, non-unique actors, Serana (period), and any teammate of the horse race. This should catch most issues. This appears to fix followers that have horses and non-unique random creatures and animals.
-- A notation: Some custom followers appear to enter playerteammate status and leave it on a whim or by design. You can always exclude these followers or use the tweaks area to reset them from auto-import, then answer no for auto-import and export (you are asked for each, one is in, one is out).

Fixes, General
- Refresh Visual no longer applies to animals. (Silver ring droppings)
- Regarding Unique followers that are Expendable Recruits: You can always hire them if their Regard is Loyal at any amount offered. They will join for a median amount if Trustworthy and for a large amount if Respectful. Regard didn't play into it before and this is just kind of a band-aid for now.

Changes, Combat Awareness
- As noted before, combat awareness wasn't really doing all that much, even when on.
- Now, when Combat Awareness is active, if the player is in combat but a follower is not, they will attempt to find a target within 1280 units, doubled if outside, with line of sight also required. They will take the player's target if that is found first.
- They will also do standard checks like friendly first and healer checks, as before.
- This continues to follow passive and defensive rules and low confidence follower restrictions.
- Real Time Checking is required to be on for this to be effective (on by default).
- This should be smart but not overly aggressive. Let me know if any issues and if so, just disable Combat Awareness. Those that have been requested a way for followers to seek out enemies, this will help without making them run all over to find people to fight.

Changes, Real Time Checking
- If a follower is a healer, they will be checked periodically if out of combat to see if the player is hurt. Not package based.
- Along with changes in the previous section, if one or more followers is actively engaged in combat along with the player, processing for CheckFollowers is greatly reduced (many things are skipped).
- Should still be low-impact. Tested with 6 followers at one time.


- Update 2.7.5 (minor fixes)

Fixes, Import Related
- Serana no longer is incapable of waiting when imported. Logic fix.
- Serana no longer caught by auto import if her own auto import is disabled.
- Fixed an issue with Import/Export not appearing on import followers that have been omitted from auto import.


- Update 2.7.4

Happy New Year! Let's hope it's better than the "arrow to the knee" that was 2020.

Installer: 
- Feature, Friendly Fire/Skill Boosts/Spell Magnitude Perks as introduced in 2.7.2 now works for LE. LE needs this: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/105121
- You need to run the fomod installer to install the required text files or place them yourself in your main skyrim directory.

Fixes, Save and Load Follower Settings
- Followers with non-standard characters in their name will now have their entire name converted to Hex format when saving. When loading, NFF will look for this format if a follower has special characters.
- This means that some followers cannot be easily identified when looking at files in the save folder. Unfortunately, this is the only solution due to a repacement table not being useful in non-English localized languages. However, at least the saving and loading will work on these followers.
- Thanks to user sizuru3 for finding the issue and offering code and a solution.

Fixes, General
- Friendly Fire perks for player and followers no longer uses "is attacking" and instead uses "weapon/magic out" as conditions. This should help help with friendly fire with lingering effects or hazards. When weapons/magic drawn, physical damage might show as 0, this is a display bug as this only actually occurs with enemy targets. This seems to also work with Dawnbreaker and vampire followers.
- Corrected "false positive" message that "follower is already in your group" when using an auto-import capable mod/addon. Supports Misty Skye and Serana from author.
- Fix an issue where Checking script wasn't running when using one or more Imported Followers. This is a past decision that has been reversed to allow for auto import.
- Improved support for Serana wait/follow states concerning teleport/auto-teleport.
- Corrected an issue where on-demand outfit switch (menu style) would not update a follower when an outfit is changed by the player, in some situations. If using the menu style, you might want to use the hotkey and set it again, just so that it sticks.
- Fixed some erroneous MCM text.

Changes, Combat
- I felt that Improved Combat Awareness was being too aggressive and causing some issues. Therefore, it is now more of a passive catch-all in the event that a follower does not currently have a combat target but combat is occuring. This should be a rare occurance. So, now, if the the follower has no combat target, it will attempt to take the player's target and if no target, will try to find an eligible one in the area. 
- Combat Awareness no longer functions for followers will Confidence of Cautious or Cowardly. These followers should no longer engage combat when applicable.
- Checking Target for friendly fire more streamlined and accurate.
- Function that check for Role (healer, tank), for Combat Awareness, or for friendly fire, now are checked every 4 seconds while in combat. It was previously only when entering combat and entering a combat state but this wasn't good enough, causing extended friendly fire issues and so on.
- Helmet is checked in inventory before removal during combat, just in case it is causing issues.

Changes, General
- On Demand Summon (hotkey or command followers) now ignores actor involved in scene OR followers looting. So, if the follower is waiting, selling (not returning) or mounted, they will be skipped. Auto-teleport will continue to ignore in the following circumstances: Waiting for Player state, in a scene, looting bodies, selling (and not returning), on a mount. This is an attempt to clear issues with users saying teleport doesn't work. I can't tell you if a follower is in a scene unless you use the MCM feature to show that in the system page.
- Outfit Sets is less aggressive and more streamlined when checking for invalid outfits at startup.
- Note: Combat functions and out-of-combat checking functions are more likely to be on so that they are more consistent. I've checked all changes using Elephant's Latency Testing tool and I consistently get 80 ms or lower for papyrus load, which hasn't changed from previous versions of NFF. The intent is to keep periodic checks as light a load as possible.
- Since Affinity had been reworked to be less frequent, Affinity Chance in the MCM, can now go as high as 65% (was 25%).

Auto-Import, Serana
- Serana should now feel more integrated into the system.
- Serana can now be auto-imported in NFF. This happens as part of the background follower Checking script, so auto-import is within 8 seconds of normal time or whenever the player changes locations. It averages out to just a few seconds.
- You are notified of auto import or export.
- It is on by default but can be turned off in the MCM. If you have given Serana a token to exclude her from import, it will be ignored. Setting is saved with NFF settings file.
- If you have import/export dialogue enabled and auto-import for Serana also enabled, the dialogue will not show.
- Serana will be imported or exported as needed, depending on the different switches on her Mental Model vanilla game script. Further she will be removed and then restored to packages as needed -- for example, prior to entering the soul cairn.
- If you have given Serana a token to ignore import and want to try this feature, do remove the token from her inventory.
- Export dialogue no longer shows for Serana as it is handled internally. You can still export her on the Slots page of the MCM, if there is an issue.

Auto-Import and Export, General
- Auto export has been re-introduced. Basically, if the background checking script sees that an imported follower is no longer a player teammate, it will dismiss them. This is an attempt to detect that an imported follower has been dismissed.
- This time around it lets you know that the follower isn't a player teammate and asks you if you want them exported in the future when this happens.
- It will also allow followers that are detected as teammates but not in NFF to be auto-imported. It only scans one person at a time, so may take a few moments if you have multiple followers that are eligible.
- This dialogue only shows once per follower for import and for export. It is on a per-follower basis. It doesn't apply to Serana.
- If you have made the wrong choice for auto-import or auto-export for an imported follower, you can now reset the dialogues and answer them again. It is available in the Follower Tweaks section.
- It does ignore followers with an Ignore Token.
- If you have import/export dialogue available, it will not show for followers being auto-imported (if you chose auto) and auto-exported (if you chose auto). You can still export any follower on the Slots page of the MCM, if there is an issue.
- It can be enabled or disabled in the MCM. It is on by default. Setting is saved with NFF settings file.
- Is saved with follower settings, if you elect to use that feature.
- It only affect a follower that was imported NOT regular followers or hirelings.
- The idea here is to streamline import and export and remove some confusion.

Translators
- You will need to translate these two message dialogue forms: nwsAutoImport_MSG, nwsAutoExport_MSG
- Please re-review changes made to translation file (english).


- Update 2.7.3

Fixes, Priority
- Refresh change is reverted when a follower is with you. When they are, a unique ring is traded to them to re-evaluate any wearable items in their inventory (pre-2.7.2 behavior). Refresh change from 2.7.2 remains when auto-checking former follower autofits IF they only have a base outfit that is defined by NFF (visual bug fix).

Previously Undocumented
- Command Followers Power - when targetting current follower can access a submenu to Save or Load follower tweak file
- Reset (quest) added prior to stopping Looting.

- Update 2.7.2

Fixes, Temporary Storage:
- Temporary Follower storage was re-designed as issues were coming from using actors to enforce a weight limit. This has possibly caused other issues, such as items going missing.
- Container Actors were replaced with actual storage containers.
- All of the functions that had to do with extra strorage were re-written.
- When applying this update, previous storage containers are replaced with the new implementation. Any items previously stored in the container actors are moved to the player chest. Existing followers are automatically set up with the replacement system.
- It should better persist where items don't go lost. I can only assume that the actor versions were getting cleared out somehow.
- I tested with one standard type follower, switching back and forth between outfit and non-outfit, placing multiple items in storage, moving to different locations far across the map and sleeping in various areas for 8 hours. All the items carried in temporary follower storage were retained.

General Fixes:
- (NFF) Horses now have "ghost" effect applied for a very short time, when spawning. This should lessen weird havok issues like horses being flung into the air.
- Followers will no longer switch outfits on horseback. They will attempt to change into their standard outfit before mounting and changing to the appropriate outfit when dismounting.
- Improved Ammo detection (slight tweak for now).
- When removing a follower mod in the running game, outfits are more properly cleared out and outfit contents are sent to the player chest (not the player).
- Fixed issue with leveled items on default outfits causing papyrus errors on mouseover.
- For purposes of crafting (torches, arrows), Anvils are treated the same as Forges since they serve the same function.
- Spells that have combat as part of their name are hidden from view. These are usually temporary effects from combat mods.
- Tweaked catch-up so that it doesn't activate while followers are sandboxing. On-demand will still work while sandboxing.
- Followers now better refresh things they are wearing. Instead of using the "trade an item to them then take it away" trick, parts of the mod will attempt to look through inventory and equip any wearable items that aren't currently worn. Affects Outfit scanning (for loose items) and follower refresh.
- Outfits are now scanned on game load (if enabled) after NFF Statup operations complete.
- Defensive Stance and No Combat Stance should now work properly. Split follow package into combat and no combat versions + rewrote some of FollowerAliasScript to fix this. Both modes tested.

Feature, Save Follower Settings:
- Finally, you can save settings on a per follower basis. You can do this in the MCM menu on the Tweaks page.
- Everything on the Tweaks page is stored, along with: Aggression, Assistance, Confidence, Morality, Helmet Hide/Show, Shield Hide/Show, Weapon Hide/Show, Ammo Hide/Show and Hire Cost.
- Only Unique followers can have their Settings saved.
- Settings files are stored individually by character name then mod name in a new folder under "NFF" called "Followers" (path: Data\SKSE\Plugins\NFF\Followers). This way you can copy them to a new location or delete them, if needed. Followers provided by .esl-based mods will have ESL listed as the mod name as it cannot currently be detected.
-- Follower Name is their full name and is used along with the name of the mod to create a way to "fuzzy match" settings to the right follower. This also allows you to easily identify followers that are associated with save files if you want to remove them or back them up. It is also due to limitations in detecting the ESL flagged mods.
- Settings can be loaded on the Tweaks page. There is no automatic load of settings to avoid issues.
- You can save Settings files for all current followers in the MCM menu.
- You can set Settings to be saved automatically when a follower is dismissed or exported.
- Settings will never be saved while the player or followers are in combat.
- This is a new feature. Please report any options not saved properly. Worst case is you'd have to manually set those as you had to do before.

Feature, Friendly Fire/Skill Boosts/Spell Magnitude Perks (SSE only)
- New option in the FOMOD installer allows you to optionally give followers Friendly Fire perk, Skill Boost perks (from vanilla game) and Spell Magnitude perk.
- Requires "Spell Perk Item Distributor" by powerofthree: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869
- This occurs upon game load, it is not delivered through MCM (one exception, below).
- Friendly Fire perk is distributed to all actors (ActorTypeNPC) and gives them a perk that causes them to cause no physical damage or destruction damage to the player, teammates and other followers (must be in NFF follower faction - controlled by NFF). This only affects an NPC that is a teammate OR is in the NFF follower faction. Also prevents shout affects when targetting another.
- Skill Boosts Perks allow magic items and potions to affect the skills of NPCs. Applies to all actors (ActorTypeNPC). Note: this doesn't cause actors to use different types of potions.
- Spell Magnitude Perk adds a perk to all actors (ActorTypeNPC) that allows you to reduce the magnitude of Destruction and Shouts when used by a follower. This can be adjusted in the MCM on the Tweaks page. The intent is to allow you to reduce the damage output of overpowered spell casting followers. It only affects an NPC that is a teammate OR is in the NFF follower faction. The adjustment itself is done via ranks of a special faction and that is translated into a perk entry point multiplier against the Magnitude of Destruction spells and shouts.
- Friendly Fire perk distribution should remove the need for any of NFF's spell patches.
- Sorry this is not for LE but it is based on external plugin, so is beyond my control.

Feature, Send Home (Command Followers)
- You can now target a former follower that has a home base set by NFF and send them home. This will teleport them directly to their base's home location. It is useful for those instances where a follower might have issues with pathing (this is often due to mods that change the worldspace and are having some navmesh issues).

Command Followers, Targetted Follower
- You can now view Spells of a follower. Spells listed with an asterisk (*) are base spells that are part of the base actor. Also shows any buffs from NFF Regard and Sharpen Weapons.
- You can Save or Load Follower Settings when targeting a current follower (Save Load Settings menu).
- Save/Load Follower Settings and Set Home Base options will not show up for non-unique followers.

Command Followers, Redesign
- There is a slight redesign to how Command Followers work.
- You can now target any actor in the game and get Health, Magicka, Stamina, Class, Level, Skills List and Spells List.
- Additionally, if the actor is a potential follower (is in Potential Follower Faction), you can recruit them, ask favor, trade, add/remove favorite and set home base. If they are potentially followers, they will be denoted with an asterisk (*).
- If an actor is not a follower, potentially a follower (is in Potential Follower Faction) or a teammate, you can command all followers to attack them. This, of course, can be done on enemies.
- Command Followers Power attack target is not present on the main menu when no target is selected.

Note on Saving other NFF Settings:
- All I can say right now is "we will see". There are issues with saving settings across mods that you might not have installed in future games. There are huge incompatibilities with .esl files and .esp (light flagged) and detection issues. In the mod groups I am part of, I see a lot of users light-flagging every armor mod they are able to, for example. There are huge issues if something gets changed in a mod. Settings can be easily saved on core parts of the mod and for followers, because this only relies on universal game values or factions or parameters introduced by NFF.

- Update 2.7.1

Site Changes, Nexus:
- I am streamlining the mod area. I am removing bugs tab, not because I do not want to fix bugs but due to too many false positives (causes lying elsewhere) and reports with no additional feedback. I have taken all current reports into notes for evaluation. 
- I am also trying to figure out what to do with the changelog section. It is huge and bloated and is laggy to view on the backend because nexus converts each paragraph to a new entry instead of using one box, formatted. I also cannot seem to remove it without hand-deleting 1000s of lines and that is beyond my life expectancy. I will likely just redirect to the top of the forums section until there is a better way on-site to manage logs.

Changes, Command Followers Menu
- You can now view a follower's skills, sorted from best to worst, under stats.
- Traits menu is moved up to under skills menu.
- You can view class and level in Traits (read only).
- You can view Regard (if in use) in Traits (read only).
- If using command followers when targeting an enemy or neutral, it will show their name displayed after "Command All" and show their Health/Magicka/Stamina.
- In almost all cases, the first entry of a menu will exit when clicked. Top entries now show either [exit] or [x] to reinforce this.

General Changes:
- Followers are now prevented from taking damage when moving to a new cell. It appears that occasionally when having 2 or more followers they could take damage from the game engine trying to place them inside of each other or inside of solid objects. This is fixed by flagging followers as "ghost" when enterting a cell (load or cell attach event) and then clearing the ghost flag after 2 seconds. You can turn this off in the MCM if you need to by unchecking "Protect Followers when Changing Cells". Note: Ghost flag doesn't turn followers into an actual ghost, they are immune to all damage and to "hit" events.
- You can now set the Gift Interval, in days, for the Regard ability that allows followers to give you gifts. Default is 3.0 days, meaning followers will only give you a gift once per 3 days in-game time. You can set this in the MCM from 0.5 to 30 days. Gift Chance has been removed. Changes only take affect on next gifting.
- You can now turn off Follower temporary storage globally. When off, it shows for no followers. This simply hides the menu entry. This does not affect Clothing Satchel functionality at all.
- A new setting "Looting Speed" allows you to increase the rate at which followers search by increasing their movement speed multiplier. You can raise it up to 600%. They will run around like ants if it is set too high but will loot faster.
- Added bool to CheckFollower function (FollowerAliasScript) to only do certain checks at load or when recruiting/importing/Hiring a follower.
- Reduced synergy chance bonus due to difference in skill significantly. You can still adjust the base chance in MCM. Some other internal tweaks. You may wish to raise base chance if you want more skill boosts to the player versus these changes. Example of what I'm talking about: If you set a flat rate of 15% in the MCM but a follower was greatly skilled compared to you (75 skill versus your 25 in skill), there would be a huge bonus to that flat rate. In this case around 80%. After brought to my attention, I felt that the bonus is too high, so now the bonus in that example would come out to about 37% instead which would be added to the rate you set in the MCM.
- Adjusted some weights on Combat Styles. Melee focused styles had Ranged Equipment Mult reduced to 0.0. Ranger and Archer not affected. Staff Equipment Mult reduced for Non-Magic types.

General Fixes:
- Tracking Followers (via Quest Journal) should no longer re-active on game load.
- Corrected accidental duplication of player tracker marker (for detecting accurate cell change). Should fix automatic outfit switching issue broken in last update. Tracking spell (constant effect) is now re-applied on game/save load.
- Fixed an issue where outfit set slots 31 and 32 were inverted.
- Fixed minor bug in MCM where Color of Light spell kept showing erroneous value.
- Voice type is now checked when recruiting a follower, in addition to at startup for existing followers.
- When dismissing a follower, if "Scan Area for Outfit Switch" is enabled, outfits in the area will be checked. Otherwise, followers will be set to either their Standard or Default outfit, whichever applies. This also occurs on flush or using MCM slots page to remove followers.

Home Bases:
- Home base markers are now referenced in a quest and should be more persistent when their locations are set. Hopefully this will help with folks having issues where followers will wander off when the cell is unloaded.
- Home, Work, Play location radius reduced from 8000 to 4096.

SOT Genesis Support:
- Detects SOTGenesisMod.esp and if present and active adds the FriendFlowers ingredient to their inventory if it isn't present. Checks followers on game load and checks when recruiting/importing a follower. Supports Expendable followers. Function is built-in, no patch. FriendFlowers is an item specific to Genesis that ignores followers for purposes of preventing encounter spawns (i.e. you want followers to have this item for Genesis to work).

CVR Followers Support:
- Adds some voiced dialogue for followers using CVR Follower Voices by Netherworks. Still work in progress.

Report Notes:
- Bugs or issues related to equipped weapons may possibly be solved by turning off "Refresh Weapons" under Gear Settings. This setting basically unequips then equips weapons upon game or save load. At no other point does NFF ask followers to unequip their weapons. So with this setting off you will have vanilla game behavior.
-- Further issues are likely related to a cause from other mods. Weapons equipping then unequipping could be related to custom AI packages causing a loop in behavior (glitch). Some features are not possible in NFF without creating custom packages, so this is a catch 22. If you use the Push/"Snap Out Of It" feature on a follower (OR shout at them and allow shouts to affect followers in the MCM) and they all of a sudden act fine, this is the cause. This cause also could come from any mod that forces an NPC to use animations.
- Items Missing from Storages. This possibly could happen but is unlikely if containers remain persistent in game. I have done all that I can to keep containers persistent (reference in script, reference in quest alias, etc).
- Followers not following, not trading, not waiting and so on. NFF doesn't really affect dialogue based actons and in cases where it uses it's own, it uses the game's style of calls. So for waiting/following I use the Waiting for Player NPC attribute and appropriate packages. Inventory is going to use OpenInventory/ShowInventory as normal scripts in the game. In nearly all cases, this is going to be a load order issue, mod interference and other external issues. For follow/wait concerning imported followers, they may be using their own customized attributes or methods, with there no way to know in a generic detection method, what is being used.

Tip:
- In my game, seems that followers are even more likely to stop infighting if you also turn on Ensure Combat Ends. This is because it stops combat if the player is not engaged, which helps.


- Update 2.7.0

Note: This is a much smaller update than I wanted to release. I was already working on outfit switching when the temporary follower storage bug came up. I didn't want multiple users to be affected by the bug while I worked on other parts of the mod.

Outfits:
- You can now choose 3 Switching Methods for Outfits: Auto, Toggle and Menu. Auto switches outfits based on location, automatically (how it was when outfits were introduced). Toggle allows  you to switch from standard/base outfit to the outfit appropriate for a location (Town/Home) then back. It stays in the outfit switched to until you switch out of it. Menu gives you a menu between Standard, Town and Home. Any choice that you select will put followers in that outfit.
- Switching methods can be applied by hotkey (only works for Toggle or Menu) or by Command Followers power with no follower selected.
- Toggle Switch may not be always intuitive unless you are sure you are in a city/town location or inn.
- Remember that even if you toggle or choose Home, followers that have Town outfits and no Home outfit will use those.

Fixes, Follower (Temporary) Storage
- A mistake was made on my part when filling aliases uses for temporary follower storage. It appears that multiple aliases could have been filled, causing their storage container to change. This gave the appearance of items going missing. In most cases, these items should still be there. Otherwise, I'm human and occasionally make a dumb mistake. This bug has been around a little while and I just now caught it along with forum comments.
- At load, a script thread is run to check follower storage for: a) followers that are no longer with you and might still be in aliases, b) current followers that might be using multiple aliases and c) both of these. The checking thread will fix all of these issues automatically. Any current followers will have items in mutltiple containers combined into one container. Any followers detected that are no longer with you will have those items send to the player chest. You will be notified if either of these happens (if you have startup notifications enabled).
- Checking a container by dialogue will no longer accidentally fill multiple aliases.
- The system loading complete message takes this additional thread into consideration. Please wait until the regular framework loaded message to appear before peeking into follower temporary storage.

Fixes, General
- Attack Enemy Command now cancels Retreat Command.
- Blades recruitment show now work if you enable "Blade Recruitment Support" in NFF's MCM in Interaction section and have moved the follower to the game slot. The reason you need to enable it is just a safety so it doesn't interfere with mods. The core issue overall is that it looks both at the follower alias and the game's follower count (not sure why it needs both but okay).
- Ordinator should no longer disarm followers, which happened as an unintended side-effect, if the player had the Terror perk. Courage now checks to see if a follower is affected by Magical Fear and instead of dispelling through removing spells with fear keyword, removed based on the magicinfluence keyword, which should sidestep the issue with Ordinator.

- Update 2.6.9

Fixes:
- Corrected an issue where outfits would not change when follower is not with you and you have the scan option enabled.
- The scanning feature for outfits now scans npcs who are in the framework's outfit faction starting with those closest to the player. Moving around a large space should re-scan for more NPCs if there are over 25.
- Fixed an error with gear slots if it is a levelled item (shows blank instead).
- Silent option should now work when sharing loot.
- Cleaned up some strings for Command Followers power.
- Fixed Follower Retreat description not showing in MCM.

Changes:
- Improve NPC Walk/Run States removed. Game value is restored if it was previously set. After that you can affect it with a tweaks mod, if you are using such.
- You can reduce gift giving percentage as low as 1%. Increments for setting this are now 1 instead of 5. Will tweak gift feature further in a later update, perhaps.
- Translators, added following strings for Command Followers Power: $FF_KeyHorseM, $FF_KeyPlaceChestM, $FF_KeyOpenChestM. There are additional translation text for "shield" in command followers power (search for shield in language file).
- Shield option can be toggled with command followers power when targeting a follower. More work to do here to sync. Will be a little while.
- Notating in guide: "Installing Other Mods" -  IMPORTANT: If you are installing mods that NFF optionally supports and you install them after you have installed NFF, you must re-run this mod’s installer.
This includes 3DNPC and RDO for certain. If you are using a mod manager that is virtualized (MO2, Vortex), NFF must have priority over these mods when it comes to changed scripts. No exceptions or things will not work. This is not a bug, is it user error due to incorrect order of mod installation.
- Built a trick into Outfit scanning that, if a follower only has a standard outfit, a unique (dummy) ring will be traded to them and then removed that will cause their worn items to refresh. This is mainly to facilitate followers that you have given an empty standard outfit to cause them to use player enchanted/tempered items.

Unresolved:
- Under "Regard System" ==> "Allow Regard" you get the same menu as under "Gold Sharing" ==> "Share the Wealth", the option "On, Silent" should not be offered there. If I try to make a setting there, all drop down menus will not work until I close MCM. Author note: I made sure "silent" works in both cases. Other than that, can't replicate bug.
- "Does not work with Serana". It works with Serana here, tested on multiple games.
- "Can't recruit anyone". Indicates that RDO may play a part. I use RDO, no issues here.
- "Convenient Horses doesn't initialize". Could be too many mods trying to do things upon a new game load. Can't replicate here but I recommend to disable some when starting a new game. You aren't going to use horses immediately when starting a new game.


- Update 2.6.8

NOTICE
- The previous adventuring gear system has been removed. Initially I thought it was a better concept as it allowed for enchants and tempering to be retained on items worn by followers. However, it not only causes a strain on the overall performance of the mod but constants fights with other features in place so I have made the decision to replace it with a more traditional outfit system.
- For existing games, once you enter the game with this update, all adventuring gear will be cleared from all followers. Nothing is removed from their inventory, it is just no longer applied. You will get a notification that the outfit system is ready. You will not see this happen on a new game. I had the notion of converting adventuring gear directly to outfits with this change but I don't think that is wise, due to complexities that can occur.
- I do understand that this might get some people upset but it is for the greater good and better in the long run. It is better for keeping things internally light and promotes compatibility with other mods. You can simply stay on 2.6.7 or earlier if you want to continue to use Adventuring Gear.

- Please DO read through these notes OR the notes in the PDF guide (NEW) before using the outfit system. At the very least the notes about the clothing satchel, which doubles as free, additional inventory.

Guide Update
- PDF Guide has been updated and almost completely rewritten. That being said there are probably bugs and it needs some expansion and revisions. However, if you wait for me to do all of that, it will be another month before I can update this mod. You'll have to be patient here.

Removal, Adventuring Gear
- The previous Adventuring Gear system has been removed.
- A great deal of code was freed up and there is less weight on parts of the system that ran conditionally that involved this.
- You no longer need to store anything. Once an outfit is applied, it is applied.
- Outfits are retained even if they are not with you and no code has to run to check them in an area.
- Though enchants and tempering (done by the player) aren't functional, when creating an outfit, the actual items are moved to a storage chest, so those are not actually lost. They just aren't applied. You might be thinking "Why aren't they applied?". There is a simple answer. The items that are in a follower's inventory that trade to them are physical copies of items based on forms (forms are more like templates than actual physical things). An outfit is composed of forms (not the things that are derived from those forms). The point you are trading items to make an outfit, the physical items go into a storage chest and that chest is read for its contents and recorded in an outfit as forms. It's like having a list of items in your hand rather than the items themselves.
- There are double the amount of possible outfits compared to previous gear.
- Systems that affect outfits (dressing and undressing pools in some mods) now work as intended. Sex mods, if you subscribe to those, also should work as intended.
- There is no longer a scripted fight between original outfit items and things in the inventory. Further, there is not longer a fight between these things and other settings like worn helmet or shield.

Changes, History
- Reworked History system. No longer uses aliases, instead uses just actor array. More reliable. Tweaked history removal. Fixed erroneous history display issues. All should work better.
- Currently, if you change from a large history length to a smaller one, it will just clip out followers that are need the end. It doesn't reshuffle everyone based on size. I would just set one size of the history you want and just leave it there.  Example here is going form 25 history length to 70, aquiring 2 followers that get recorded, then going back to 25 will remove the last two from history.

Fixes
- Dialogue for Hiring Guards updated to affect global variables set by the player instead of base prices.
- Removing the Relax location of a base, no longer removes the Work location instead.
- Background tasks now tell the framework when they are finished, giving a more accurate representation of when the system is ready. Before I had an artificial delay in place.
- Finally fixed Serana's Hood issue, where you can keep her script from trying to constantly put it on.  It will stay off even if you do not change her armor. You can change this in the Oufit and Gear section if she is imported.
- History now removes any actors that have have the same actor base, which should remove duplicates. This shouldn't be a common occurance.
- You should no longer see Dismiss Steward dialogue once removed as a steward (Hearthfires).
- Werewolf description in the MCM fixed.
- Expendable Followers can now ride horses supplied by NFF. However, since they are non-unique, they cannot be given ownership of a game object.  This means we have to assign a faction to own the horse, so if you have more than one expendable, they may ride each other's horses. This is not resolvable as is an inherent issue with how permissions work in Skyrim.

Changes, Miscellaneous
- Huge change with restructuring of the MCM to make it easier to follow. It was becoming a clutter festival. Now there are more sub-sections that will guide you to different aspects of the mod. Hotkeys and notifications are now set up in those sections.
- Conflict Keys will now check for conflicts in NFF along with the vanilla game keybinds. It will also check conflicts with other mods IF those other mods have created key conflict support.
- Brand new guide with features more easily able to be understood. It is in PDF with an index. If you are unsure about a feature or about to make an assumption of how something works, read through the guide.
- Import/Export dialogue option is now off by default for all npcs. You must enable this feature for it be present in dialogue, with the understanding that you know the possible ramifications of allowing the dialogue.
- Removed Blades support entirely. If you want to handle making someone a blade, put them in the game slot. You can use the outfit system to change the blades gear to something else. There is no reason for me to continue to fight with other blades mods.
- While I go into it in the new guide, concerning the reasons why, to balance out the temporary follower storage versus the clothing satchel unlimited capacity, I have increased the follower storage weight limit massively (350 to 5000).

Feature, Outfit Support (Overview)
- Create outfits for up to 200 individual followers (that means double compared to the previous system). Only "unique" followers are supported. Supports Imported followers, thouigh this is at your own risk. If an imported follower has extensive outfit features of their own, you may wish to instead use that.
- Provides additional inventory in the way of a clothing satchel. When an outfit is first created, any worn clothing, armor, jewelry and similar items in the follower's inventory are moved to the satchel (to prevent a bug that could destroy worn items, see further along). You can use the satchel for a complete additional inventory, if you want, but it is good practice to put items that could be worn in there.
- Create a standard, town or home outfit for each follower (their style within an outfit set). The mindset with this design is that the standard outfit is what they wear while adventuring/combat, the town outfit is what they wear in semi-casual to casual environment, the home outfit is for a very casual environment. All are optional, so you can just create a home outfit, for example.
- Outifts can contain any armor or clothing items. Other items are not supported.
- If a town or home outfit is defined, followers that are currently recruited, imported or hired will switch to those outfits. Further, if you don't have a home outfit defined and you do have a town outfit, going into a home location will use the town outfit (they defer to their most casual attire).
- At any time you can create or change the contents of a follower's outfit. You will be shown a trade menu, similar to how Adventuring Gear worked.
- Items are stored in a chest specific to that unique outfit slot, for standard, town and home, and are never lost.
- At any time, you can return to a follower's original outfit. Returning to the follower's original outfit will return the actual physical outfit items to the player's inventory.
- Automatic maintenance is applied at game load if you have removed followers (mods) who were previously given an outfit, to free up outfit slots. Once you reach 200 outfits across 200 followers, you will not be able to create more outfits until one or more sets are removed.
- Outfit changes are permanent, even if you dismiss them or export them from NFF. Currently, town and home outfits are not supported when a follower is dismissed, they will change into their standard outift, if they have one. Otherwise, they will change to their default outfit.
- Some concepts adapted from work done by ConfusedChim, author of Simple Outfit Manager. However, my implementation uses enhancements via SKSE, so the code is different. However, it is fair to give credit here for the structural ideas.

Outfit Support (Dialogue)
- Applying and removing outfits is done mainly with game dialogue, in order to handle dynamic options that change depending on whether or not the follower you are talking to has an outfit and which ones.
- When talking to a follower and choosing "I need a moment of your time. (NFF)", you will have access to "I'd like to create an outfit for you.". This changes to "I'd like to change an outfit of yours." if you have one more outfits defined. From here you can set up a general, town or home outfit.
- Under the same NFF submenu, you will see "I'd like to remove an outfit." if you have one or more outfits defined.
- Outfits will immediately change if you are in an area appropriate to their style (standard, town, home).

Outfit Support (Command Followers Power)
- When targetting a follower you will now see "Set Outfit/Inventory >" which you can use to create their standard outfit or remove it. You must use the dialogue to set up town or home outfits. It is just too complicated right now to make the power menu dynamic.

Outfit Support (Hotkeys)
- You can use the system section of NFF's MCM to set up keybinds for creating or removing a standard outfit on a targetted follower. Only supports the standard outfit.

Outfit Support (MCM)
- Though you cannot apply or remove outfits in the MCM, you can get an overview of the outfits in use and see the items used in each style of a set and the armor slots for currently displayed items. This is in the Outfit and Gear section of the MCM.
- Here you can elect to exclude outfit dialogue for a displayed follower (if they have their own system or you don't want to be tempted to manage them). If one or more styles of an outfit are applied to a follower, this option will be greyed out until you remove outfits from them.
- You may also elect to hide the entire outfit system from all followers, where dialogue is concerned. This can be toggled in the Quest and Dialogue section.

Clothing Satchel
- The clothing satchel is free, additional inventory for any follower using NFF's outfit system.
- You can put anything you want in the satchel, but the intent is to keep clothing items separated from the outfit.
- You cannot have a satchel without an outfit. If you just want extra inventory, create a home outfit only for your follower. If you don't really want a home outfit, use the MCM to clone your follower's outfit and use those items to define a home outfit. For ease of use and implementation, satchel and outfit are tied together.
- There is an additonal purpose for the satchel. It is to work around a bug in Skyrim where applying an outfit while there are other wearable items in the follower's inventory, will overwrite those items, destroying them. This is more likely to happen if an outfit is being set and the follower has similar items to the outfit. For example, the follower has vanilla leather armor, loose or worn, in their inventory and an outfit is applied that also has vanilla leather armor. This can come from an outfit that you define OR the outfit that comes with them.
- NFF will attempt to move out all wearable items and put them in the satchel when an outfit is first defined for a follower. You can also elect, and the safest route, is to take all the wearable items out by trading with the follower first, especially if these are unique items (Gloves of the Pugulist is one I had trouble with myself).
- The satchel currently has no weight limit. To get a weight limit, I have to create 200 persistent actors to use their carry limit as containers and instead I used persistent copies of containers, which is lighter. I am taking the lighter route for smoother experience.

Outfit Support (Follower Storage)
- As a follower with an outfit automatically receives a satchel, temporary follower storage is disabled for that follower. Essentially the satchel replaces it as a permanent storage feature. Any items in the follower storage will be move to the follower's satchel when an outfit is first created.

Outfit Support (Auto-Looting)
- All cases of Follower Storage automatically change to the Clothing Satchel.
- Looted wearable items are automatically send to the clothing satchel instead if the follower is looting wearable items.

Feature, Outfit Support (Drawbacks and Considerations)
- If using a different Outfit manager on a follower (outside of NFF), either continue to use that for that particular follower or restore them to their default outfit BEFORE using the Outfit system in NFF on them. You cannot have both in use on an individual follower.
- As stated earlier, currently town or home outfits do not change when a follower is not with you. This may be possible in a future update.
- Also hinted at earlier, outfits do not retain enchantments unless those enchantments are part of objects found in the game. This means that player enchants will not apply to outfit items. Enchants driven by the player are applied to world objects, not to the forms that represent them. An outfit is a collection of forms.
- Tempering armor driven by the player will also not be applied to outfit items for the same limitations as described above.
- Creating an outfit does not prevent a follower from wearing things you might trade to them. You are just creating the base layer in this regard.
- Outfits are not switched while a follower is in combat OR is waiting for the player.
- Even with the drawbacks above, the outfit system will have better compatibility with stripping features from other mods, optional armor items like wigs or having to fight with other aspects of NFF that involve equipping something.
- When a follower switches from one outfit to another, they will temporarily be set back to their original outfit, after which the new outfit will be applied. This is by design to allow the visual display to successfull switch.
- I recommend not including shield (and possible a helm) in an outfit. You should instead freely trade those items with your follower. This will help when using other systems in NFF that affect equipment.
- Though I feel this system is implemented in the safest way possible, there have been cases generally with outfitting systems where changing an outfit MAY overwrite clothing or armor items in a follower's inventory, IF those item location types are present in their outfit and an outfit is switched to. This seems rare but in Skyrim any kind of weird bug can happen, so I advise you to not give your followers lots of extra armor or clothing items to carry around if their outfit is being managed. Just in case. Periodically save your game. Just in case.


- Update 2.6.7

Notice on Combat Gameplay Overhaul:
- Initially there were reports of issues between NFF and CGO but I was unable to test since Nemesis would not install for me at the time. I have it installed now, along with CGO. I was skeptical that NFF was a cause of issues since NFF does not provide any animations or changes to animations. From my brief observations:
- In the MCM, under CGO, uncheck NPCs Change Grip. This will correct a bug where NPCs will no longer re-equip 2-handed weapons. It affects ALL npcs, so this is not an NFF follower based bug and therefore I have no "fix". If you have any other issues, I would recommend to uncheck NPC's Dodge. Unsure if this causes any issues but the smart thing to do when narrowing issues would be to eliminate settings that could affect followers.

Update NOTE: Make sure Followers are "solid" before updating. If you have previously used "Enhance Sneaking Alpha" at a value different than 1.0, set it to 1.0 first, as this feature is removed.

Fixes, Miscellaneous
- Fixed an issue where temporary Adventuring Gear lists were not being cleared. Now cleared on recruit/import.
- Corrected an issue where follower names aren't updated properly for history display.
- Followers using NFF's horse packages now ignore combat while the player (and they) are mounted. Once the player dismounts, combat can occur for followers. Will possibly make this an option in the future.
- Due to a variety of potential issues, "Enhance Sneaking Alpha" is removed. This was only a visual setting, no real gameplay change here.
- Depreciated and removed "DLC1_QF_DLC1RV06_010058CA". This was a marriage fix from long ago. Recommend that if your "spouse to be" is a follower prior to having a wedding, move them to the game slot FIRST.

Changes, Miscellaneous
- New loot setting in MCM, "Looting Delay After Combat". This is the delay, in seconds, that looting takes place automatically after combat (if active).
- New loot setting in MCM, "Loot Start/Stop Delay". This is the delay, in seconds, when asking followers to loot by command (not automatically after combat).
- "Recommend Gear Storage" MCM setting is now on by default. Only affects new games. Changed because I feel it guides those new to Adventuring Gear. Gear not storing by default is confusing if not used to the system.

Features, Share Wealth
- You can now elect to share loot with followers whenever threshold is met. "Share Randomly" setting in MCM.
- You can now elect to share loot with no dialogue prompt. "Ask to Share" setting in MCM.


- Update 2.6.6

Fixes, Favorites
- Favorite lists are now checked on game load to move missing followers when a mod has been uninstalled mid-game. This happens in the background and can take a couple of seconds if you have several lists. You are notified if one or more lists have been corrected.
-- Note that how formlists are handled, this shouldn't be happening at all, so this is a formlist script bug being corrected.
-- Corrects multiple papyrus-related errors that could occur as a result.
- Fixed an issue where renaming category enters the wrong name into the entry field by default.
- Calling follower to you updates Adventuring Gear if persistent.

Fixes, History
- History lists are now handled again properly.
- Added bonus, followers that are with you upon loading with this fix will be added to history if needed.

Changes, Favorites
- Favorites now shows current location of actors.
- You can now summon all actors that are part of a favorite group. You will receive a message if successful.
- You can now set all actors that are part of a group to wait (only works if they are currently recruited/imported). You will receive a message if successful.
- You can now set all actors that are part of a group to follow (only works if they are currently recruited/imported). You will receive a message if successful.
- Looking into the possibility of adding other commands for favorites so you can perform additional tactics.

Changes/Fixes, Sandboxing
- Trying to fix some issues where follower might not be responsive.
-- Raised Restart Sandbox function to delay from 1 second to 5 seconds. This is the time it takes for sandbox to be checked after player moves into a new cell. This may just be too fast of a check to allow everything to load.
-- Removed individual follower sandboxing start feature in case it was also causing issues. Followers now start sandboxing simultaneously.

Fixes, General
- Fixed an issue where flee package causes followers to say panic voice lines.


- Update 2.6.5

Feature, Multiple Favorite Follower LIsts
- You can now have up to 10 favorite lists instead of just 1.
- Each list can hold up to 25 followers. That's a total of 250.
- You can name or rename lists.
- You are otherwise able to manage lists - remove lists, add lists, etc.
- The first list cannot be removed in its entirety. It is the default list.
- A one-time maintenance will copy all old favorites (from the 1 list previously) to the new system into the first list.
- Only works with the Command Followers power (UILib).
-- You can target a potential follower and add to any list.
-- You can target a current follower and add to any list (under Extras).
-- You can manage lists and such when targetting nobody.
-- You can move any follower from history to a favorite list. Moving a follower from history removes it from history.
-- Currently you cannot move between lists but you can remove a follower from a list and they will be moved to history. From history you can move them into a different list.

Changes/Fixes Ammo
- Fixed the infamous Skyrim arrow bug. This bug occurs when a game is loaded and a follower using a bow/crossbow will not fire their bow until you remove the bow and arrows and trade them back.
-- This was corrected by looking at a follower's weapons and if bow or crossbow is equipped and ammo is equipped then the ammo is unequipped, then force-equipped, then equipped with force flag off.
-- This happens on load, changing cells or after looting. It should be very seamless.
- More arrows and bolts are added to the default ammo list. As before, trading modded arrows/bolts to any follower will add them to the list if they are not already there. Bolts are now supported. You will need to trade Dragonborn specific items.

Changes/Fixes Combat Styles and Combat Packages
- This is kind of a big change but due to erratic behavior caused by using custom packages, it had to be addressed as it might be partially the cause of followers occasionally not fighting (because they are bugging out).
- Like Traits (Aggression, etc), Combat Styles are applied when you set them on a follower AND at game load via a maintenance script. This is done on the base actor form, so will NOT support non-unique followers. This means that combat styles are no longer tied to combat AI package.
- Combat AI packages (with one exception) are handled via standard game packages.
-- Combat Range and Retreat/Attack will still work as before.
-- If using Werewolf Form via NFF, Unarmed Combat Style is still on a package but transformed followers will follow standard range.
-- Combat AI packages that feature "Stay with Player" option are still using custom packages but vastly more simplified. This is because no vanilla packages would fit the parameters I want.
-- So, to summarize the important points. There should be no funny issues that arise from Package AI in combat, unless you are using Stay with Player option. Combat Styles can only be applied to Unique actors (no guards, no template-based actors) - This is because a change to ONE guard will change every guard in the game. This is basically the "way it goes".

Other AI Package Changes
- As indicated, some packages are being change to templates provided by the game. Focus on whether or not those packages are essential for core functionality or are less complicated to handle and/or vanilla templates are close enough to match the previously custom ones.
- Healing Packages (outside of combat) are vanilla template based.

Fixes, Home Bases
- Reworked and checked the code for several functions.
- Fixed an issue where moving home marker would cause followers from the previous base to move into the current base.
- Additional care taken to make sure different combinations of base management don't cause followers to move to the wrong base.
- Skipping menu selections when making a new base no longer causes issues.
- Residents are now refreshed correctly when needed.

Fixes, General
- Fixed eye glitch for some users, hopefully (don't experience it here). QueueNiNodeUpdate is sent to followers when exiting stealth.
- MCM text for "Ensure Combat Ends" now correctly states that it defaults to Off.
- Fixed issue where applying persistent gear on demand wasn't starting the appropriate quest.
- Calling a former follower to you now refreshes their gear if persistent.
- Fixed some broken MCM text.


- Update 2.6.4

Notes: Smaller issues, mostly minor, but annoying enough to handle these now.
To Update: Just remove old version, replace, go right into game and allow follower slots to sort.

Fixes, General
- When looking through list of potions when using Potion Recovery, fixed a bug where the last item was ignored.
- Auto-Looting breakers (distance from player, sneaking by player, entering combat) now work indoors.
- Auto-Looting now refreshes weapons on followers when completing to fix a bug where idles used by the looting AI package can cause a weapon to get stuck and a follower to not fight.
- Refresh Weapons now handles equipped spells on game load.
- Slight cleanup of Combat AI Package.
- "Refresh All Adventuring Gear" (Command Followers power) will now unequip all items from followers and then re-equip.
- Corrected an issue where creating a new home base or assigning a work/relax location would move other residents to that base automatically. Needed a distinction between new base and moving an old base.
- Gifting can occur in a location marked with the player home keyword.


- Update 2.6.3

Installation, Existing Game
- I strongly advise dismissing all followers, fast traveling to a new area or entering a new cell, wait 3 hrs in-game. Save your game, load your game. Re-acquire your followers. This is due to some scripting changes and we want Skyrim to release these scripts and not hold old versions in memory.
- Protip: Create a temporary base where you are currently at. Just assign a home location. Set all your followers to that base before you dismiss them. This may help you re-acquire them faster.

Fixes, General
- Slot strings array updated so that notifications show the proper slot number.
- History now allows over 50 followers if set higher than 50.
- Slow time in menus now mutes sound.
- Followers should now be able to give gifts to the player again at the appropriate Regard rank. Reminder that this only happens in town. You're probably going to get some catch up each hour for each follower you currently have where this applies.
- Followers now can craft torches again, if allowed to.
- Rewrote the teleport script functions more cleanly. Followers always teleport ahead if used "on command", otherwise they teleport behind (yes, I reversed the interior behavior because I didn't like how it felt).
- Followers can no longer be teleported or auto-teleport if they are involved in a scene (includes crafting).
- To reduce false-positives, all 3DNPC followers are excluded from Import function.
- Refresh Weapons now attempts to refresh ammo that Skyrim may not recognized at game load. Keep in mind that this is a game bug fix when loading into a cell when first launching the game.
- Follower in the Tank role no longer taunts if there is only one enemy. This seems to a large cause of the tank stopping all combat.
- Finally experienced and fixed the issue where dismissed followers at a base would wander off unexpectedly to some odd area. This could happen if you make changes to the home location or move it due to the way the master packages are designed (they aren't fully refreshing). Therefore, moving bases or changing followers now clears old followers out and puts them back in.
- Animals and pet followers should now be restricted from crafting things, even if it appears to be selected. This is a quick, band-aid fix for now. If they have the animal keyword on their race or actor OR have the keyword dwemer (construct) and do not also have the actor npc keyword, they are ignored.
- Many minor fixes and tweaks.

Changes, Follow Packages
- Instead of using a custom, multi-use package, the former follow AI package is now cut into vanilla-based packages and placed on the follower's AI package stack.
- Should reduce the erratic movement and run-in-place bugs.
- There are 3 packages for each range (far, standard, close) for normal following.
- There are 3 packages for the same ranges if you are using defensive mod (with the combat flag off).
- There is a flee package used if the follower gets too close, isn't in dialogue or a scene and now is above sandboxing AI package.
- Blocking idles, if you use this setting, is now handled by using a silent voice line that should be at the top of the dialogue choices (stack) if NFF is lower than RDO and similar mods that add idle lines to followers.
- When logical and able, followers are told to re-evaluate their package stack because switching packages (versus procedures in a package) is much slower.

Changes/Fixes Persistent Gear
- Compiler error had included an older "work in progress" version of Persistent Gear script into the last version of the game and has been corrected.
- Now using alternative, more precise method of checking to see if gear needs to be checked in an area.
-- A hidden constant spell is added to player. Does not function if Persistent Gear is disabled or the player is in combat.
-- Does occasional checks based on distance of an invisible marker or if the marker is actually loaded into a cell. This is fairly light.
-- You can now set Persistent Gear to only be checked in Towns, Cities, Dwellings, Player Homes or any area where a Home Base marker has been dropped (note: to make this light it does not check work or play locations). This is on by default.
-- Gear is only applied if it has been unloaded by the game, so just entering/exiting cells doesn't constantly reload equipment.
-- You can be notified via message if gear is being applied. There is a 3 second delay prior to this occuring. A max of 15 targets in the area remains.

Changes, General
- Followers can now comment when the player is crafting potions.
- You can now access or move the player chest with no time limitation in towns or cities or within a home base (main location). Player cannot be in combat.
- Using the Command Followers power with no followers now brings up the History menu.
- Followers can now craft 3-5 torches at a time if less than 8 torches are in their inventory. They will stop making torches if they reach 8.
- Improved accuracy of targetting follower with command followers power. Note that targetting in 3rd person mode at moderate distance (without target name showing) is in front of your "character", not the "crosshair".
- Gear Page in MCM and in Command Followers power shows how many gear sets are in use.
- New entry under Inventory in the Command Followers power allows you to "Refresh All Adventuring Gear" when no actor is targetted. This will refresh all current followers and any followers with persistent gear in the loaded area. It may also help with other bugs on followers where all gear items are not drawn by the game.

Changes, Command Followers Menu
- Optimized all of the code.
- Reorganized some areas to reduce entries or make submenus more understandable.
- Added back functionality to some submenus that didn't have it.
- Integrated in the ability to set loot category and loot destination.

Feature, Follower Storage
- Framework now has temporary storage feature for followers.
- This gives them their own additional storage of up to 350 lbs. It is safe and can be used while the follower is with you via dialogue.
- When a follower leaves your service, all stored items are moved to the player chest. You may wish to move those items into their normal inventory first, sell them or just let them exist in the player chest.
- Why temporary? This gives you pack mule storage without you and I having to manage all of that across a limited number of followers. Permanent storage would require extra chests placed in the world and would only handle 50/100 or whatever number of followers and you still have to figure out where to put their items if you remove extra storage from a follower.
- You can disable extra storage on any follower on the tweaks page of the MCM. It is remembered even if you dismiss them. This setting ONLY hides the dialogue, it doesn't disable/enable chests. Any contents are always dumped upon dismissal.
- If you have followers at the start of this update, you must enable them having a chest by using the dialogue once as chests are assigned sequentially. This does not affect newly recruited followers.

Feature, Auto-Loot
- Followers can now be set to auto-loot dead bodies, containers and items on the ground.
- Important note here at the top. During testing, I found that the game will consider actors lootable (flag as dead bodies, possibly) if they are in a bleedout state - this means that followers could loot each other. For this reason, a function checks through all current followers to see if any is in a bleedout state. If they are, a delay of 5 seconds is sent. After the delay, they are checked again. If a follower is still bleeding out, the looting will stop entirely. So if you called a loot or it occurs after combat and there is no message and nothing happens, you know the situation.
-- Occurs on demand (hotkey or command followers power) or after combat. After combat loot can be toggled on/off in the MCM and it is off by default because of the previous note, so that you acknowledge this when turning it on.
-- You can set each individual follower to loot gold, ammo, potions, food, ingredients, miscellaneous, armor/weapons, only armor, only weapons, books or plants.
-- Followers will search the immediate area for 90 seconds, up to 2048 units from the player. Time and distance from player can be changed in the MCM. If exiting combat in order to loot, there is a 2 second delay before it starts.
-- Followers can loot items and place them into their inventory, their follower storage (if enabled) or automatically send them to the the player's chest. Set in the MCM on a per-follower basis. Sending gold to the player chest will instead send it to the player.
-- In the case of miscellaneous items, only gold, animal hides, animal parts, tools, gems and ores/ingots OR items with a base gold value of 100 or more, will be picked up. Other items will be dropped to the ground and not picked up by any followers. Can be toggled on/off in the MCM. You can also adjust the minimum gold value.
-- Followers that can loot plants will gather from bushes and trees.
-- Followers will (silently) drop books with a gold value of 0.
-- You are notified of what followers pick up. Can be toggled on/off in the MCM. You can also toggle on or off notifications for dropped loot, if you are curious to what they are skipping.
-- You can toggle on/off the ability to loot with kotkey or command followers power.
-- Looting is cancelled if the player stealths, goes out of range of the initial looting location, changes locations, mounts or he or the followers enter combat.	
-- Looting halted for any follower within short moderate of the player chest.
-- Looters will not steal items and generally ignore items owned by someone else.

Technical Notes, Auto-Loot
- To keep from interfering with existing AI package stacks, looting package is run from a quest with a very high priority. Sandboxing and Crafting will not occur while followers are looting.
- Many item categories are hard-coded and cannot be added to or altered. The cannot be filtered to drop items without causing conflicts with followers in other loot categories.
-- Food items include beverages, cooked food and raw food.
-- Potions includes any items that are consumed that have magical effects, including alcohol.
-- Ammo includes arrows and bolts.
-- Armor and Weapons includes ammo.
-- Miscellaneous Items includes gold and a ton of junk items (these can be filtered out). Nothing is prioritized so they can pass gold up.
-- Books are normal books or spellbooks.
-- Plants can loot from bushes and trees along with containers and items just sitting around.
-- There are no categories for: scrolls, soul gems or "everything". Again, these are hard-coded by the developers.
-- Plants and Ingredients cannot be combined into looting for one follower.
-- Tokens from other mods are silently dropped, hopefully. This is detected by dropping any item that doesn't have a object name on its form or is marked as non-playable. Examples are tokens from FlowerGirls and hidden physics objects for SMP.
- When items are dropped, they are flagged to only be able to be picked up by the player (ownership). This can't be set while an item is in a container, so this is why those items are dropped. Otherwise, followers will get caught in a loop of looting an item/returning it to a container. Once the player picks up these items, ownership is removed.
- Looting is not efficient all the time. Followers may miss things because they aren't as smart as the player. While Miscellaneous does loot gold as well as other items, setting a follower to only gold is more accurate because they are only focused on one thing. This is as accurate as I can make it work for now.
- Looting is sometimes more accurate when calling it on-demand instead of allowing it to just occur after combat ends.
- Looting is generally slower than the player doing it but they can find items that you miss.

Tips & Tricks, Auto-Loot
- Spreading different categories of items between different followers will allow more of a variety of items to be collected.
- Having the same category on multiple followers will help focus on items in that category.
- Considering 4 followers, these setups tend to work well:
-- General: 1 potions, 2 misc, 1 plants.
-- Crafter: 2 misc, 1 ingredients, 1 plants.
-- Mercenaries: Have everyone just pick up gold or misc (which picks up gold as well, just not as affectively).
-- Set any ranged followers to pick up ammo and use their own inventory as send to.
- Make use of extra inventory to keep items separated so that you can sort through it. Use the player chest instead if you'd prefer to sort through multiple items at once.
- Sheathing your weapons, so that followers do the same, will make them move between items and bodies faster.


- Update 2.6.2

Notice
- Upon loading in an existing game, the number of Home Bases will be expanded from 10 to 20. Give this a couple of moments. You will receive a message when this starts. I recommend you save your game after the version update completes. This does not affect a new game.

Fixes
- Base Traits that can be applied when acquiring new followers now applies the correct values instead of applying as 1 higher.
- Follower Protection on/off now applies correctly in MCM.
- Added PlayerFollowerFaction to Calm Followers Power conditions.
- Added PlayerFollowerFaction and CurrentFollowerFaction to friendly fire conditions.
- Improved Followers gradually moving to the player's location while sandboxing.
- Waiting followers that have been dismissed no longer use vanilla message. Instead, you are notified of which slot they are removed from and if they are heading to a Home Base.

Improvement, Home Bases
- Speed up some of the Bases code in the MCM. There is likely more to do here. Speed goes hand-in-hand with how many followers are occupying bases - more residents makes it slower, which has to do with papyrus' mediocre array functions.
- Increased the number of followers that can dwell across all bases from 100 to 200.
- Increased the number of creatable bases from 10 to 20.
- Fixed the issue with followers not sleeping in beds.
- Followers in Home Bases no longer talk in their sleep (idle lines).
- Raised Sandbox range of followers in Home Bases from 4096 to 8192.
- You can now remove all followers from a base (MCM), move all followers to a different base (MCM), Remove all residents from a base (MCM), Move all residents of a base to a different one (MCM).

- Update 2.6.1

Slots Change
- No longer using the game's original Animal Alias (slot 1). This means aliases 0 and 1 are ignored for the most part. Hopefully this will fix issues where other mods may think that a follower in slot 1 is an animal.
- Additional Slot added to compensate but you are prevented from using (original) slot 1. In other words, Slots (aliases) 2-11 are used for followers.
- This change is self-adapting if you happen to have a follower in (original) slot 1 when updating. Sorting slots will automatically fix this as well in the event that the game or some mod puts an animal is the animal alias.
- I personally didn't have any issues with the slot change. As stated, it is self-fixing. However, you may need to save, load and use "Restart Main Quests".

Follower Gearing
- This required some more streamlining, thinking and testing, so bear with this.
- Optimized Equip Event.
- Reduced (hopefully removed) additional interactions between hiding certain items (Helm, Shield) and applying Adventuring Gear.
- Fixed an issue where including a Shield/Helm with Adventuring Gear and setting one or both of those to hide outside of combat would cause a cycle of equipping those items over and over if they are taken and traded back to the follower.
- Removed all naked checks and function (for naked pool/undressing events) as the optimizations no longer require this.
- Optional, on the Adventuring Gear page in the MCM, under "Halt When Gearing", you can now freeze the target while applying adventuring gear. They will stay in place until they start putting on them items you have defined.
- Optional, on the Adventuring Gear page in the MCM, under "Show Gear Slots", you can now show what slots Gear occupies on the follower. This is helpful for quickly determining if two gear items cover the same slot (and therefore likely to be causing interaction issues - blinking on and off of items).
- Mousing over Adventuring Gear items will show their name, armor rating, type (light, heavy, none) and slots they occupy.
- MCM page changed slightly to better accomodate space when many Gear items are in use.
- Even though interactions have been cleaned up between Adventuring Gear items and Helm/Shield, I recommend not including these items as part of Adventuring Gear if you are hiding them as there will be less interactions when equipping. MCM descriptions now reflect this.
- Checking armor items now looks at leveled item lists (if present) more consistently. Currenly does not handle nested lists (lists inside of lists), though this shouldn't be common.

Combat
- Added stability to combat based script functions.
- Streamlined Combat Awareness to only affect aggression and player teammate status.
- Reinstated direct manipulation of aggression stat when using Combat Awareness. This is an attempt to fix a bug that might be caused be some other mods that perceive an aggression affecting spell as something else.
- Optimized friendly fire detection due to instability when handling enemy minions. They can despawn causing errors.
- Fix implemented for a game bug that keeps a follower in combat with no enemies around. If a follower is in the "in combat" combat state (and not searching for a target), the player is not in combat and the follower has no combat target, she will be removed from combat (stopcombat). This seems to happen more with followers that are in close range and casting spells + performing melee (Serana, spellswords, etc). Can be found in the MCM menu as "Ensure Combat Ends". It is off by default.

Player Horse
- Fixed a bug where disabling a horse then saving and exiting the game would remove the horse when loading the game. This only applies to horses you would buy at stables, not Shadowmere and other horses.
- Since a linked reference cannot be enabled, this was fixed by removing the old horse and generating a new horse for the player if their last ridden horse was a stable-bought horse and it was disabled.
- I DO NOT recommend using this option with Immersive Horses or Convenient Horses. You may lose special horse features if horses governed by these mods are disabled/enabled.

Taunting
- Taunt now keeps dragons grounded for 12 seconds (taunt duration).
- Please be aware that taunting has to stop combat on the enemy in order to redirect the flow of combat. This can, in some cases, cause the enemy to restore health. This is no way around this, so deal with it or don't. I haven't experienced this as a frequent occurance.

Misc Fixes/Changes
- UndressActor function is depreciated and removed from the main Controller script.
- Created an ActIsLoaded bool function that checks to make sure a follower's 3D is loaded and they are in a loaded cell. This is now called before casting a spell and  fixes a few occasional papyrus errors.
- If using Autobox and in a valid area that supports it, ramp-up time is ignored - they will automatically go into sandboxing mode.

Feature, Player Chest
- The player now has access to a protected, persistent storage container. This is to help aleviate pack-mule situations.
- Place Player Chest allows the player to move a chest to them that only they can access as additional, protected storage. Cannot be placed in dungeons. Can only be moved once per 4 hours, in game.
- Open Player Chest allows the player to open the Player Chest remotely, anywhere in the game, once per 12 hours (game time).
- These actions can be hotkeyed or accessed via the Command Followers power when no follower is selected.
- This may lead into storage options in the future for individual followers, where the Player Chest would be used as a catch-all container.
- This feature is new and will be fleshed out over time.

Feature, Relax
- Relax Idle Delay and Relax Ramp-Up can go as high as 60 seconds. So, for example, if you want followers to take up to a minute before beginning to relax or coming out of a relax state. Keep in mind that traveling to a new cell always takes them out of sandboxing state.

- Update 2.6.0b
- Couple of quick fixes.

Fixes
- If keeping horses around (those provided by NFF), a follower horse is only summoned if the player has a horse, the horse is not dead and is loaded and in the same cell as the player.
- Additional check to make sure SetInvulnerable is false after follower transforms into a werewolf (if using NFF's system).
- Better handling of animation events for "Weapons only in Combat".


- Update 2.6.0

Notes
- I personally did not dismiss followers prior to updating but you may wish to.
- I tested all the combat changes and gear fixes in the civil war campaign using 8 followers along with Deadly Wenches being all of the opponents. It remained stable and acted as expected. I checked papyrus logs constantly.

Fixes, Refresh Weapons
- Weapons are no longer force-checked if Refresh Weapons is off (acquiring follower, loading a game).

Fixes, Applying Gear/Gear Related
- Corrected some issues with some gear settings. "Headwear only in Combat", "Shield only in Combat", "Auto Unequip Quiver" and "Weapons only in Combat" should now work properly.
- "Auto Unequip Quiver" now works separately from "Weapons only in Combat".
- Follower now registers for player sheath animation event for sheathing weapons if "Weapons only in Combat" is in use.
- Shields are Torches are not part of "Weapons only in Combat" checks.
- When activating "Shield only in Combat" in MCM, detected shield is now unequipped, if not in combat.
- When activating "Headwear only in Combat" in MCM, detected helmet is now unequipped, if not in combat.

Fixes, Combat Related
- Courage effect from Regard is now only cast on demand, if a fear effect is detected during combat. If you are using Ordinator, the Terror perk was causing a weapon drop from the permanent effect. This should be fixed. If you have any further issue with this interact, you should turn off the Courage Regard ability in the MCM.
- Courage effect now only removes fear. The confidence actor stat is no longer affected.
- Fixed an issue where an opponent might disappear mid-combat (summoned minion) and cause multiple functions to fail.
- Regard, Synergy and Recharge are not calculated at the end of combat if the last opponent was essential. This should help with some issue where these things could accidentally be exploited. 

Fixes, Follower Script Streamlining
- Cleaned up OnItemAdded event on followers.
- Streamlined OnObjectEquipped event on followers.

Fixes, Home Bases
- Fixed some issues involving start and end times for work, relax and sleep where conditions weren't properly being evaluated in home bases. This mainly happened when evening times rolled over to early morning time and dealing with a 24 hour clock. If you aren't changing the default times, then relax time should now be working properly.

Fixes, NTMD Apocalypse
- Removed Light flag from esp.

Changes, Combat Sense
- Aggression stat is no longer directly manipulated. Instead a spell raises Aggression, if needed.
- Followers with Aggression of 0 or set to 0 in the MCM are not affected by the Aggression spell mentioned.
- Fixed an issue where combat sense may be checked if it is disabled in the MCM.

Changes, Combat Styles
- Double-downed on equipment score multipliers. I was leaving a little bit of wiggle room for some actions, like 0.25 (0.0 to 10.0) for magic users, but then it seems they will run in with a dagger, sometimes over casting spells. Here are the changes:
- Archer: Melee at 0.04
- Beserker, Defender: Ranged at 0.04
- Magician, Priest, Wizard: Melee, Ranged, Unarmed at 0.00.

Feature, No Combat State
- You can set a follower to not react whatsoever to combat.
- This may be useful if you want to have a pack mule follower or a healer that never engages with the enemy.
- Followers with this option enabled will act pretty lifeless and oblivious during combat. You may wish to increase their follow range to Far.
- If, alternatively, you want a dedicated healer that will still engage the enemy and be more lively, I would do this:
-- Set their Traits to Unaggressive, Cautious and Helps Nobody and apply the Priest combat style to them.
-- It will not work flawlessly but should be adequate.


- Update 2.5.9

Note
- There are some minor issues that I need to fix here and there but nothing game breaking. These are things like optimizations I'd like to do, smoothing out of some features and occasional weird bugs. Quite frankly, I wanted to get this update out to fix the issue where you might trade with a follower and the item doesn't get traded to them and just disappears. This was from a selling items feature bug. It's important to fix this but I just don't feel like spending a lot of time on this mod over the next few days. Need a break.

Some minor issues that I am aware of:
- There can be some lag when using some hotkeyed features in NFF that bring up menus on a targeted follower (Set Gear, Trade, etc). Just be patient and wait an extra second or two.
- Sometimes targeting a follower at a distance to set gear can pick up two followers accidentally. However, set gear is only shown for one.
- If a player horse dies and you don't use the call player horse hotkey or Menu Command to resurrect the horse, you will lose the horse permanently if the cell gets unloaded. This is kind of normal game behavior.
- Calling a horse when a follower is close by sometimes will cause the follower to mount your horse, GTA style.

Fixes, General
- Fixed an issue where activing Command Followers ability could create a loop and cause enhanced menus to not work.

Fixes, Selling
- Cleared up code involving a storage container that wasn't being used.
- Framework now clears inSellMenu variable which was preventing items from being traded to followers in some cases. This was likely the cause of disappearing weapons or other objects.
- Added additional check (Gift Menu is open) when handling OnItemAdded, OnObjectEquipped, OnObjectUnequipped events.

Changes, Auto-Teleport
- Followers will not auto-teleport into or within the following areas: Skuldafn, Sovngarde, Whiterun Underforge and Apocrypha.
- You can still manually call a teleport to allow followers to enter these places.

Changes, Player Horse
- You can now call the Player's horse from the Command Followers Power, if no follower is targeted.

- Update 2.5.8

Fixes, 3DNPC
- Added changed scripts (followerinpc.pex, animal3dnpc.pex) to neuter it's friendly fire and waiting functions where a follower might get dismissed. These functions should be solely governed by NFF.
- Dismissing a 3DNPC that is a hireling (hireling faction), should now be rehirable at no cost. This is the base function of the game's hiring system, not NFF's optional hiring system.
- Removed Auto-Kick from 3dNPC followers. This would fire off if it was detected that the follower was not in the playerfollowerfaction.

Fixes, Follower Checking
- Removed deep checking solely on having one or more imported followers. This should lighten the impact of checking script when imported followers are in use.
- Fixed an issue where a change to nwsFollowerCount global wasn't triggering a check.

Fixes, Use Shield Only in Combat
- Use Shield Only in Combat function on followers rewritten to be more logical and is streamlined.
- Use Shield Only in Combat now shows stored shield, if any, in MCM. If stored shield is not shown, trade with the follower, take his shield and trade it back to update storage.
- Removed redundant UsedShield variable from followers.

Fixes, General
- Horses no longer spawn indoors. Oversight.
- Only Wear Specified Gear now uses SKSE unequipitemEx to help prevent temporary loss of magical effect from equipment. This may have only happened with interaction of other mods using certain types of unequip functions. Not sure if this is an actual fix, could be a game bug. Item enchantments, especially player-made ones, are buggy.
- Tweaked horse spawn distance from followers. Factored in distance of follower to player.
- Now checking for None instance of a form before using GetItemCount.
- Slight tweak to CombatAwareness function.
- Smoothed out Improved Stealth calm effect.
- Can now acquire summoned player minions, if support is enabled in the MCM.
- Follower OnUpdateGameTime functions restructured. Waiting time counts even if 3D not loaded (only for purposes of dismiss on 3-day wait).  Hire rate still counts if 3D is not loaded, so if you owe a follower money and they are waiting and they have had enough, they will leave the party.
- Affinity change was too drastic, reduced to smaller value.
- Sandbox now starts correctly when the first follower is acquired in a new game.
- Roggvir's Execution situation where followers sandbox during the execution should disable sandboxing while in the SandboxOrigin cell if the execution quest is running.

Changes
- Restructured Single Follower Menu. Set Gear/Inventory submenu is removed. Inventory and Set Gear functions are on the main menu. Sell Items, Headwear, Undress, Redress are in the Utility Menu.


- Update 2.5.6b

- Fixed an issue with player's horse alias.
- Player's horse now travels to the player again.


- Update 2.5.6

Notes
- Emphasis made to reduce some stress of followeralias script and to add some minor features.

Installer
- ConsoleUtilSSE is still not working for me in the latest version of SSE, so I've added an option that you can install batch files to change the class of followers.
- Select the follower in the console.
- Type: bat nff(name of class).  For example, bat nffrogue for Rogue.
- Classes are: assassin, barbarian, conjurer, destruction, elemental, monk, mystic, necromance, nightblade, nightingale, ranger, rogue, scout, sorcerer, spellsword, thief, warrior1h, warrior2h, witchblade.

Changes, Spawned Horses & Mounting/Dismounting
- Tweaks made to Spawned Horses wasn't thorough enough in 2.5.4. Too many small bugs and hangups required it to be rebuilt.
- Horse code is heavily optimized.
- ALERT: Loading the game while followers are mounted causes a game bug where followers may not dismount - The 3D does not want to update. Fast traveling will fix this. Saving your game while not mounted will, of course, avoid this.
- Special Effects are no longer applied while a follower is currently mounted as it can also apply to the follower with no way of removing it.
- Horse-based functions are now moved to a script dedicated to handling mounts, attached to the existing nwsFollowerMounts quest. This relieves pressure and issues occuring with other scripts trying to do their own thing. Followers no longer individually monitor player animations.
- Horse Options are blocked from being changed in the MCM while the player is mounted. It can cause issues. Section headers will notify you of this.
- Spawned Horses will no longer be disabled while ridden.
- Spawned Horses are no longer disabled to apply special effects.
- You can no longer call the player's horse while the player is riding a horse.
- Follower horses now properly increase their ground speed to 125 if under this value.
- Lowered ranges on calling horse to a follower from 4096  to 2048.
- Horses now spawn further away from followers.
- Followers are better at pathing to horses to mount them. This should send a single onUpdate call to each horse and followers should try to move to them simulataneously.
- Horse mounting is slightly faster if not using horse special effects.

Changes, Debug (MCM)
- You can now see the name of the mod that an NPC comes from, the name of the mod running a scene on an NPC (if any), the name of the mod that an NPC's AI Package belongs to (if any).
- Debug information text was cleaned up.
- Split Force Follower and Force Marriage into two separate click functions. You can run both at the same time on a targeted NPC.

Changes, Courage
- Courage now applies the Rally effect (raised confidence) and has a very long duration. It is reapplied if the follower is feared. Confidence stat is no longer directly changed. Streamlining tweak.

Features, Horses
- New option for calling player horse. Enabling "Call Disables/Enables Nearby Horse" will allow the hotkey to disable the horse if it is near or enable it if it is disabled. If you are using Convenient Horses or Immersive Horses, use with caution as I don't know if there are interactions. So essentially you can hide the player's horse when you don't need it and it will not fast travel with you all over the place.
- New Menu Option for "Global Horse Skin": Random Pick. This assigns a horse skin randomly to any follower using a spawned horse if a horse hasn't already been assigned for them. Only picks from "normal" horse skin types: Brown, Black, Black and White, Grey or Palomino.

Features, Elope
- If you have Elope enabled and use Force Follower Faction on an NPC, you can elope with them even if they are not marriage voiced.
- Elope only provides the following marriage benefits: Cook Meal (1x per day), Collect Gold (from spouse setting up a store), Lover's Comfort buff (as per vanilla game). You cannot choose a house for them to live in via vanilla/hearthfire means but can use Bases feature in NFF or something like MHIYH.
- Does not work on children.
- Experimental at this time.

Fixes
- Fixed an issue where followers might not sneak if improved sneaking/stealth is disabled.
- Fixed an issue where followers stop moving if the player walks forward + left or forward + right.
- Now forcing flag "Must Sneak" on improved stealth package.
- Fixed a conflict with USEEP on Riften Ragged Flagon keyword. Dialogue conflict (Blades) with USEEP is required at this time.
- Function that checks if an actor is a animal now also check that the actor or its race is flagged as ActorTypeNPC for purposes of humanoid detection.
- Fixed an issue where dragon actors could potentially be imported into the framework.
- Fixed an issue where Persistent Gear would activate if disabled but you load a game in the same cell as a former recruit.
- Fixed non-translated text in Command Followers menu.
- Raised the combat count required to possibly award Affinity skill gains to the player when followers are performing actions. This doesn't affect the change just the combat start and stops required. Was 6 + (0 to 4 random), raised to 12 + (0 to 6 random). Just felt too frequent even when lowering the chance significantly.
- Raised teleport (auto teleport or on demand) to 256 units behind the player (up from 192).
- Rewrote Stealth Calm (lower aggression) to always check for stealth calm affect and remove it, if switching to an AI package that is not NFF's Stealth package.
- Rewrote remove light when stealthed to be more consistent.


- Update 2.5.5

NOTICE
- If you are updating from 2.5.4 to 2.5.5, a reset will be forced on the dialoguefollower quest and all followers dismissed or exported. This is REQUIRED to fix issue caused in 2.5.4. Sorry for the inconvenience but this is the safest route to go.

Fixes
- Fixed critical issue where incorrect versions of some script files (vanilla version) were included, causing followers to no longer dismiss, recruit, wait or follow properly.
- Corrected an issue where a follower may attempt to cast a spell while 3d is unloaded (or in a different cell).
- Allow Extra Craftables is now stored when saving a profile.


- Update 2.5.4 (Final)

Notes: Small update. Should not require you to do anything. However, safest option (from this point forward) is to dismiss all followers, Save, Update, Load game.
- ConsoleUtilSSE appears to be bugged in Skyrim version 1.5.97. Setting Level and Class is currently not working. SetSelectedReference command works, but the follow up command, ExecuteCommand is not working. Nothing I can do about this.

Fixes, Spawned Horses
- Animation Events on Controller Main Script now serve only to tell followers to evaluate package stacks. Old events are cleared if detected.
- Followers now check mounting as part of "OnPackageStart" event. If player is detected to be mounted, this will fire off summoning behavior, then they will mount.
-- At this time, player mounting animation and playing jump standing start animation (for Convenient Horses Fast Dismount) are registered for each follower.
- Packages will be used as normal, either NFF's riding package or Convenient Horses riding package (or some other thing's riding package, doesn't matter).
- Once the player performs tailHorseDismount or JumpStandingStart (CH) animation, animation event will be signalled to the follower, causing them to dismount and horses disabled (if allowed via NFF options).
-- At this time events are unregistered from the followers.
- Lot of fundamental changes on how the process works this time. Should be stable.

Fixes
- Tweaked "Followers stop moving when in short range to the player" internal change. Reduced range to 256 units, added "player is not sprinting or running" conditions.
- Removed unnecessary changes to and inclusion of PlayerFollowerPackage. Substituted with similar package based on vanilla template.
- Followers with Improved Stealth no longer stand up when near the player (in non-combat situation).
- No Team Magic Damage: All conditions/changes removed from spells that target self as they will not fire off. This means these spells can hurt others for now. May look at it at a future time but dont want to futz around with it right now.
-- From Base NTMD: Blizzard.
-- Apocalypse Magic NTMD: Fingers of the Mountain (base spell effect), Flamestrike (base spell), Frost Nova, Inferno, Shattering Crystal, and Shock Nova.
-- Elemental Destruction NTMD: No changes.
- Added condition to "No Player Damage to Teammates" setting that ignores spells that are self-targeted.

Changes
- Refresh Weapons no longer removes weapons in favor of just unequipping them. Will see how this works. Again, does not remove anything from inventory.
- Refresh Weapons is much faster (processed on follower alias script).
- History Popup menu (from menus or shortcut) should now be nearly instantaneous. It no longer reads all locations on load. You can use "Refresh" at the end of the menu to update all locations (for past followers that might be traveling).
- Allow Extra Craftables in Crafting/Interaction, shows Candlelight Tome, Hidden Helmet, Ignore Token and separate Hood for Serana at the forge, if enabled.


- Update 2.5.3

Note
- When having a large number of followers (near 10, can be less) and entering some cells, such as the Arcaneaum, the player may get displaced and fall into a different area (such as an upper level). There is no resolution to this at the moment as I cannot fire a fix off by anticipating what the player will be doing before they do it and entering a cell blocks package evaluation. Right now the only solution is to command all followers to wait, then command all to follower you after entering the cell.

Fixes
- When using "Refresh Weapons" setting, non-playable weapons are no longer removed as they get stuck. They are instead temporarily unequipped.
- Refresh Weapons now uses a separate, dedicated storage container.
- If during Refresh Weapons, something gets stuck (likely if you interrupt the process somehow, across multiple followers), weapons are sent to the player. This check happens both while processing followers and at the very end, for double coverage. If this happens, check your inventory for missing items.  If you have notifications for framework enabled and you wait until you get the final notification that NFF is ready, this shouldn't occur.
- RemoveAllItems functions are now using (slower, safer) RemoveItem on each individual item.
- Multiple gifting notifications should no longer occur.
- No longer receive Applying Gear message if Persistent Gear is enabled.
- Auto-Teleport now overrides sandboxing followers if the follower is in a different cell from the player and meets the range requirement. This fixes some issues where followers would be sandboxing at a great distance and teleport would not work.
- Teleport On-Demand now should work under nearly any circumstance. The exception is teleport is prevented when riding horses.
- Taunt and Detection of enemies now requires line of sight. This is a toss up between not grabbing enemies behind some simple obstruction and trying to fight enemies through walls. Leaning more towards not fighting enemies through walls.
- Followers stop moving when in short range to the player (512 units) and the player is not moving (forward or backwards). This is applied to Steath and Follow packages provided by NFF. This has two effects. One, this helps to prevent a bug where many followers following the player into a new cell that contains a very small area (stairwell, hallway) could cause the player to fall through the world due to the displacement of too many objects (this is not 100% fix). Two, followers should collide less into the player when he stops moving and then are still in running/sprinting motion. This is baked in at the moment, let me know if there are any issues from it and I will make it into an option.

Tweaks
- When crafting, doubled the amount of arrows are made.
- Auto-Teleport (warp) now works in combat. However, range requirement is increased (range set x 1.5) and the actor must not be engaged with a target. Let me know if any issues arise from this and I will make it into an option.
- Auto-Teleport (warp) now considers follower is a different cell from the player a valid reason to teleport (couple with range requirement). This means that it will override sandboxing behavior if the follower is too far.
- Auto-Teleport height detection is now equal to half of range requirement.
- Refresh Weapons is now off by default. Only affects new games or those prior to 2.5.2.

- Update 2.5.2

Note
- New readme in the works for describing features. It's going to be a little while.
- Before updating, IF you have a full roster of  followers (all slots filled), make sure that if you are using spawned horses offered by the framework that you and your followers are not mounted. If you accidentally update while followers were mounted, flush the slots to remove all followers then re-acquire them. I have to force the mounts quest to stop and be restarted.

Fundamental Change:
- Due to constant issues, reported by others, of the game (or mods) trying to manipulate the original first follower slot (default of index 0 in the vanilla game), this slot is now mostly ignored by the framework.
- The regular framework slots are now 1 to 10 instead of 0 to 9. Followers are kept from entering slot 0. Cosmetically, you shouldn't notice any difference.
- You can elect to send a follower to the Game Slot (slot 0) or remove them from this slot. Only do this if you think that a vanilla quest needs to retrieve a follower in this slot. Examples would include getting married (put the NPC in this slot before speaking to Maramal) or bringing a Blades recruit to Delphine (again, put the NPC in this slot prior to speaking to her).
- You should not leave a follower in this slot for an extended amount of time as the issues reported could happen - Follower randomly leaves, doesn't catch up, is captured by another quest and so on. I cannot give you a list of every scenario.
- Sorting follower slots (including updating the framework) will automatically clear the game slot and move the follower to the next available slot.
- Hopefully this will help with random issues but I have to express that this is something of a guess as I've never experienced this behavior in game.

Fixes
- If Persistent Gear is disabled, worn items should be cleared when dismissing a follower. This prevents the game from deciding to randomly outfit dismissed followers.
- Stealth package no longer forces sneaking animation on followers. Prevents a bug where they would stay crouched for extended periods of time.
- Followers in Defensive Stance or Sneaking are now more responsive to actions that would take them out of those conditions.
- MCM optimized to always read page strings.
- When auto teleport is enabled, followers will be teleported to you when you change locations. This should speed up them catching up when fast traveling or entering a new cell.
- I am still noticing a game bug where the follower's inventory shows certain weapons that they can use being equipped but it doesn't visually appear on the actor and causes buggy behavior. This usually occurs on game load and can fix itself when moving to a new cell. It is random. However, I've reworked re-equipping weapons for followers. There is a new setting called "Refresh Weapons" that now moves each follower's equipped weapons out to a hidden container, moves them back and re-equips them. It is on by default and only occurs when loading a game. You can turn it on or off in the MCM under Actions.
- Perk list visual space in the MCM now better balanced.
- Alchemy Boost and Skill Boosts now show in perk list. General Skill Boost is shown under Alteration as it has no real tree placement.

MCM Changes
- Some options shuffled around to reclaim UI space
-- Setting follower count is moved to the slots page.
-- Setting Recommend Gear Store, Allow Empty Gear and Persistent Gear is now at the top of the Adventuring Gear page. Will display even if no followers are recruited.
-- Allow Colored Messages is now at the top of Notifications.
-- Enhanced Menu settings are on the System page, but on the left side, near the bottom.

Command Menu Changes
- When targeting a single follower, there is a no longer a wait submenu. Instead, you can toggle between "Is Waiting for You" and "Is Following You". Get Behind Me is now on the extras menu.
- You can now change follower crafting and tavern options on a single follower via a submenu. These are all toggles. Craft arrows is a triple toggle between arrows, bolts and off.

Summon Changes
- You can now summon all followers or individual followers when using the command followers menu. Only enhanced menus.

No Team Magic Damage Change
- Removed changes made to Ice Cloak Freeze, Firebolt and Flames used by Atronachs (only, doesn't affect magic using npcs otherwise) to remove conflicts with perk mods.
- Shouldn't have too much effect over the course of a game.

Feature, Work/Relax/Sleep Times
- You can now set work, relax and sleep times in the MCM.
- It is set for every home base. You cannot set it individually.
- Sleep only works outside of work and relax, so set this range outside of these times. Think of Work as their day job or daytime activity. Relax as going to get some leisure time/dinner/tavern carousing. Sleep as not doing either of those things.  If you want a long sleep period, make Relax time short or don't set a relax location.

Features, Take Ownership of Home Base Cells
- You can now take ownership of a cell that you set as a home base (or work/relax location).
- This means that items in the cell belong to you and aren't considered stealing.
- NFF can also allow you to take ownership of beds in the cell of your home base. This means followers can sleep in them.
- If active, you are always asked if you want to take ownership before NFF does anything. You receive verbose warnings one-time, then shorter confirmation dialogues.
- Only works on interior cells.
- Up to 25 furniture items are scanned at once in an area. Any item that has "bed" in the name will be set to player ownership. For a cell with lots of chairs, beds and stoves you can re-set the area as your home/work/relax location to scan for another 25 items, just get close to the beds.
- Ownership cannot be reversed. It is too complicated to restore ownership of any number of individual eligible items + cell. Work case scenario should be that there is no longer a private owner (other than you).
- Do not take ownership of areas that are public, like a tavern, store, the jarl's bedroom and so on. Unless you do not care that something weird could happen. Save your game first!
- It is not advised to take ownership of beds in areas that assign beds to your children (Hearthfires) as their beds are no longer assigned to them, if this concerns you. No, there is no keywords assigned to beds to be able to ignore specific beds as skyrim doesn't handle furniture that depthfully.
- This is an EXPERIMENTAL feature, use with caution.


- Update 2.5.1

Critical Fix, OnMagicEffect (Fear)
- There was lag and occasional Stack Dump caused by using "OnMagicEffect" event on followers to detect being hit by a fear spell (for Regard benefits).
- This was noticable when fighting very large groups of enemies with casters and just the presence of this event could cause issues.
- This event has been removed and there is now a quick fear check only once per 4 seconds. Description in the MCM has been updated.

Fixes
- Update Functions and Persistent Gear are delayed if the game is in a loading menu, console or any other detectable menu mode. Stability tweak.
- Fix for issue where follower might double-dip into weapon recharge and other "exited combat" activities.
- Fix for PlayerFollowerPackage stopping Default Follow setting and causing issues with Imported Followers. The intent of Default Follow is mainly to allow imported folk to use their own packages. Makes an edit to PlayerFollowerPackage by adding a condition (not in a NFF specific faction, so no effect on NPCs that borrow it).
- Game-filled Black Soul Gems now properly work when recharging after combat.
- Recharge Special Effect played when one or more Soul Gems are used.
- Equip and Unequip events on Follower alias are ignored when giving items to be sold.
- Fixed some errors when checking the actual follower count.
- Cleaned up some friendly fire issues.
- Cleaned up Flush Slots function.
- Reset Main Quests is now more robust.
- Many MCM descriptions have been updated.
- Streamlining of Functions.

Fix, Command to Sit in Chair/Sleep in Bed
- These functions now work again but only if the follower is in wait mode. There are two ways to do this (also beds, benches, etc):
-- Command the follower to sit (hold E on them, then point to chair, bench, etc) and wait for the animation to completely finish then click on them again so that they are in wait mode.
-- Put them into Wait first (dialogue menu or command power) then command them to sit in a chair. Doesn't appear you have to wait for animation to end but you have to wait for it to start.
- While waiting, they will sleep or sit until you have them follow you again.

Change, Startup
- The framework checks for the presence of SKI_ConfigBase.pex which needs to be seen in Skyrim/SSE in the bsa file or loose in data/scripts. If this file is not detected, you will be issued a warning and the system will be halted. You will have to fix this before continuing to use the mod.
- The framework also checks general position of this mod in your load order. If nwsFollowerFramework.esp is in the upper two-thirds of your load order, you will receive a recommendation to place it more towards the end of your load order. This message will only be shown once unless your load order changes and is again valid. This only checks position and not specific mod conflicts.

Changes, Enhance Sneaking
- Adds the invisiblity effect to them without any visuals.
- Completely muffles their movement.

Changes, Improved Stealth AI
- Applies the magic effect calm instead of directly manipulating aggression. Should be same effect.
- Do not engage in combat while the player is sneaking unless the follower is attacked directly or the player is hurt in combat (detection can take a few seconds).
-- Currently, there is an animation bug that followers will stand if the player is engaged in combat. They are still invisible/muffled if using Enhance Sneaking. If you set their alpha value to a value other than 1.0 and they are still semi-transparent, you will see that stealth is still engaged.

Changes, Packages
- Consolodated follow packages (they were split by range, if idles are allowed or not) from 6 to 1 package. Less packages to process, simple with no mental processing.
- Bump package was removed and combined to follow package.
- Several unused packages were removed.

Change, Potion Recovery
- You can now use potions on followers if they are at 50% or lower health. You can still use potions on them if they are in bleedout.

Feature, Number of Followers Allowed
- You can now set the maximum number of followers allowed in the framework, from 2 to 10. The default is 10.
- If you set the number lower than the current limit and you currently have followers, they are flushed from the framework, after which you can reaquire them. This does not happen if you raise the maximum above its current value.
- This was done mainly to create a global variable that other modders can use, nwsFollowerMaxCount. I went ahead and added an interface if you feel the need to limit yourself artificially.
- If an attempt is made to force the value above 10, it will have no effect and be reset to 10 as soon as detected.

Feature, Persistent Gear
- If enabled in the MCM, you can now have the Adventuring Gear of dismissed followers be re-applied when the player is in their vicinity.
- Up to 15 former followers in a cell/location are supported. This is "per cell", not a total of 15 followers.
- Former followers must have their Adventuring Gear stored.
- A check is made upon game load, entering a new location or entering a new cell. Only one check is made at any given moment, other checks are ignored.
	-- Location checks are only made when going from a old location to a new one and only once per 3 minutes of real time. (this is because locations can change rapidly and we don't want this to spam).
	-- Load checks are only made after all other startup activities have been completed.
	-- Cell checks are not made if the cell is still loaded in memory.
- This does add to papyrus load. However, it is set up as a remote call (Registered as single update) so it's more or less a background process.
- Credit given to kuroko137, Author of Dress Up Lover's NPC Outfit Changer, for the concept. No code was directly used. Check out his awesome mod!
- Mods that remove gear periodically may cause an old outfit to be applied. Examples are stripping pools and intimacy mods.

Feature, Defensive Stance
- On the tweaks page, you set up a follower to act defensively in combat.
- In this stance, the follower will not attack unless the player has attacked first (hurt during combat, can take a few seconds to register) OR the follower has been attacked (struck in combat). Followers will also engage if the target they have acquired is within short range (about 395 units or the other side of a small room).
- Is set on a per-follower basis, so you can have a mix of tactics.
- Only occurs during combat.
- This works regardless of Aggression of the follower.
- Mainly package-driven, so should be light.

Feature, Payment Per Follower
- Weekly Follower Cost remains (as Initial Weekly Follower Cost) on the gameplay page. This is the base value (now 0 to 2000 gold). Setting to 0 means no cost.
- Cost can be set specifically for any individual follower on the stats page.
- It is remembered per follower, always.
- As prior, housecarls, spouses and (detected) family members have a starting cost of 0.

Feature, Transform to Werewolf
- Followers can now be set to transform to werewolves when they have taken a certain amount of damage in combat.
- This is on a per-follower basis and can be set on the tweaks page, including at what damage they transform.
- If you want a follower to transform often set the damage threshold near or at 100%.
- Werewolf followers do not generate fear/crime from other NPCs just by transforming. There is no "limit per day".
- Werewolf followers have boosted health, unarmed damage and can knockback opponents just like the vanilla Werewolf race.
- Only Unique NPCs (so, no guards and all of that business) that are not animals or mechanicals are eligible. Otherwise this is greyed out. There is no way around this.
- I suppose vampire followers can turn into werewolves if you really want this. No, I'm not restricting it, just don't use it on them if you don't want it.
- Casters cast spells as werewolves. They will also use caster combat behavior (staying at range). So, basically they aren't very good candidates unless they are hybrid melee/casters.
- Followers that have a role in NFF (Tank, Healer) can still do those things. Healing has no animations.
- Followers will not be werewolves if not in the party. This is script-controlled and will not work on dismissed followers. There is no way around this.
- Unlike other werewolf transformation mods, followers with custom skins can transform.
- There is no "transform back animation".
- These things are not included and unlikely to be included in the near future and possibly never: Custom werewolf skins, werewolf powers like the player has, werebears, werecats and so on.

- Update 2.5.0

Core Change
- Followers are now filled in ascending order (low to high) in the DialogueFollower aliases instead of descending order (high to low).
- This should provide compatibility to mods that look for the standard vanilla alias at the first index (0). So for example, multiple blades mods you will have to make sure the follower you wish to affect is in the first slot in NFF.
- As slots are automatically sorted on a new update, this will fix itself automatically.

Command Menu Features (Single Target, Follower) - Enhanced Menus Only
- When targetting a follower, you can now set their home base (or switch it, or remove them from being in a home base) in the follower menu.
- You can now target any potential follower (a follower in the PotentialFollower faction) and affect them with a custom menu:
-- You can look at their base stats (Health, Magicka, Stamina)
-- You can recruit them (same as "Follow me, I need your help" type action).
-- You can command them to do a favor.
-- You can set their basic traits.
-- You can (force) trade with them.
-- You can add them to or remove them from Favorites.
-- You can set their home base.
- Does not work on hireling followers (Jenassa, etc), nor on import or expendable followers.
- Issue: does not recognize conditional dialogue of vanilla (or mod based) followers, which allows you to circumvent recruitment. Example is Uthgerd the Unbroken, that requires a brawl prior to hiring. I would advise you to not circumvent this if you know that a requirement should be met prior to recruitment.

Command Menu Features (Single Target, Non-follower) - Enhanced Menus Only
- Targetting an enemy or neutral/friendly (outside of Potential Follower Faction) adds an entry to the Command All menu that allows you to cause all followers to attack that target.
-- Attempts to use the player's combat target if the player is in combat and no actor is targetted.
-- Followers that cannot see the target (darkness, line-of-sight) may not attack.
-- Followers that have a Confidence of Cautious or Cowardly are not forced to attack (but still may enter combat state and attack if enemies are trivial).
-- Can be hotkeyed as a standalone ability. However, no menu is provided, so there will be no confirmation.

Command All Menu (No Target) - Enhanced Menus Only
- Can use a Retreat function to cause followers to ignore combat for 45 seconds. They will move back to the player.
-- Affects all followers within 1000 feet.
-- Can be used again (via the menu) to cancel the effect.
-- Causing all followers to attack a target also cancels the effect.
-- Can be hotkeyed as a standalone ability. Can be toggled here as well.

Command Menu, Stop Time - Enhanced Menus Only
- You can now stop time while in the menu system. Can be toggled on in the MCM under the System tab. Currently plays muffled sound effects that may be hard-coded into the game.

Follower Alias Fixes
- Fixed an issue where regard got set to 0 when dismissing a follower.
- Fixed an issue where multiple tweaks weren't getting flagged to update (Gear: Shield, Helm, Weapon; Skill Affinity, Weapon Charge, Regard Awarding).
- Some bool flags removed as they were hitching the alias script.
- More comprehensive checking of "3D is loaded" and dead or invalid actor.

Miscellaneous:
- Sleeping Wenches/Barkeeps are no longer valid for Tavern Interactions.
- Fixed Error on stopping sandboxing on a follower during main script update when no actor is registered.
- Changed import conditions for Serana to check for her script variables (IsFollowing = True, CanFollow = True) for import eligibility instead of GetPlayerTeammate.
- nwsTargetAlly_script changed to nwsFollower_TargetAllyFX for mod consistency. nwsTargetAlly_script is now added to list of dummy scripts.
- Command All ability projectile (for detecting distant targets) now has a slight cone detection. Sped up projectile speed significantly.
- TrapTriggerBase and TrapBear scripts (optional install) additionally check for framework's follower faction for simulated lightfoot perk.
- Storm Call voice power called by the player should now work properly. Conditions removed from this "spell" in no team magic damage add-on. "magicProjectileStormScript" script has been modified (with no additional properties added) and will be installed via the FOMOD for LE and SSE. Lighting strikes when cast by the player should ignore player teammates and those in the framework follower faction. I don't have a save where I can currently test this but theoretically it should work properly.
- Notated in MCM that Damage Multiplier adjustments do not affect magic attacks (beyond my control).
- Applied some general optimizations.

- Update 2.4.9

Game Loading:
- The startup messages (Performing Startup Tasks/Tasks Complete) are shown to give you an idea when it is safe to engage in normal gameplay and especially when it is safe to save your game. NFF does quite a few things in the background at start up, particularly because some settings are not stored in your save file (Skyrim normal behavior) and have to be retrieved and re-applied to your followers. The more followers you have, the longer this process takes. This doesn't mean that you have to sit and wait and not do anything. Wandering around or heading somewhere is generally fine. What you don't want to do during this process is anything that could completely halt processes (going into console, saving your game, fast traveling, entering a new cell - anything that causes a pause in the action, so to speak). Usually it's only a few seconds (2-4), so it isn't a  long warm up time.
- I also recommend that you try to use full saves when possible versus quick-saving. I also recommend you turn off auto-saves. Quick saves and auto saves do not always halt scripts upon saving and it is possible (but not guaranteed) to cause issues (save corruption, botched scripts, etc). If you use SSE Engine Fixes (or something similar with its capabilities), I would set "RegularQuicksaves" to true in it's ini file - this allows quick saves to create full saves.
- I've artificially added 0.5 seconds to the startup process just to make sure things are as problem-free as possible.

Combat Tweaks:
- Tank Taunt should now be more effective in bringing the attention of enemies to the tank. Taunt Range extended to 250 feet. Taunt not usable on flying/swimming enemies. Keep in mind that other followers (or the player) attacking a taunted enemy can pull them off of the tank.
- Followers will now evaluate combat more effectively upon entering a combat state. This should help resolve issues where they do no react when hit or the player is hit. They should continue to not preempt attacking when the player is sneaking and you are using enhanced stealth. You can toggle this on or off under combat in the MCM (Improved Combat Awareness). If you want some followers to act passively in battle or you encounter some other issues, turn this option off.
- Reduce Infighting mechanism restored to similarly how it was done before, by checking periodically during combat. OnHit event no longer in use as it was actually too fast and efficient and not preventing combat. Some specifics of how friendly fire is resolved were changed internally.  Fix: Turning off Reduce Infighting no longer protects followers from each other.
- Added stacking protection on follower alias script for OnCombatStateChanged, OnMagicEffectApply events.
- Check Count script ignores followers that are in combat if there is a case where the player is not in combat. Nothing to do with the player striking a follower, that is different.
- Have noticed an issue where a follower who is taught Candlelight will occasionally cast it in battle. I could put a combat condition on the spell form but for now, I've set it up where you create a Nether's Candlelight Tome that will teach NFF's version of the spell to you or your followers. You can create it at the forge under Jewelry using 1 charcoal, 1 paper roll, 1 common soul gem (found filled) and a firefly thorax.

Miscellaneous:
- Fixed an issue where (stored) Adventuring Gear might not get applied when re-recruiting a follower. An uncleared flag was blocking this.
- Checking to see if follower is naked now includes boots and gauntlets keywords on worn items.
- Removed Eval Package from Home bases package stack. Don't feel implementation was very good. Home bases now evaluates packages if it needs to. Removed Script: nwsFollower_HomeEval.pex and added to dummy scripts install option.
- Added slight randomization to tavern responses.
- There is no longer a temporary blocking (jilted) dialogue for imported followers. It causes them to get stuck following you while unable to interact with them.
- Fixed slot slots to where all variables are cleared or moved.
- Fixed clear alias to where all variables are cleared.
- When sorting slots, followers at moderate distance of the player (2048 units) will be put into waiting mode until sorting is finished, then return to following mode and have their packages evaluated.
- Followers no longer sandbox while in a scene outside of the framework quests. Should help with issues where interaction between followers in other mods will work correctly IF they are scene based.
- Added a toggle for sandboxing, Only Sandbox in Non-Dungeon. This allows you to have followers sandbox nearly everywhere but restrict them to following you exclusively in dungeons. For this to work, the dungeon needs to have a location and have the LocTypeDungeon keyword.

Additions:
- Optional native support for Misty Skye and Summer Skye in the FOMOD installer. This essentially treats them as if they were native followers (seamless import/export, forced to very high priority package support). Patches 4 dialogue script fragments included in The Erotic Adventures of Misty Skye. They should act and feel like normal followers.

- Update 2.4.8

- Fixed issue where retrieving follower count would get skipped and never checked. This could have potentially caused multiple other issues if the follower count was stuck at zero. These should self-resolve upon next game load.
- When recruiting/importing a follower, there is a an additional sandbox check, just in case and a check is only made if sandboxing was shut off (you had 0 followers or the 0 followers bug).
- Casting Candlelight now uses non-custom package to prevent repetitive action game bug.
- Crafting can no longer occur in locations with dungeon keyword.
- Taunt range and taunt enemy detection ranges are now doubled.
- Fix implemented for History not showing recruiting follower without going to MCM menu first.
- Fix for refresh of History Display when moving history recorded follower to Favorites.


- Update 2.4.7

Note: I am taking a break from working on this mod exclusively and putting lock on adding too many new features. I've put a lot into this mod and it is not being abandoned, just want to work on other projects.

Changes
- Colored Notifications can now be toggled on or off via the MCM. They are off by default, so you have to turn them on if you want colored messages. Leave off to fix some issues with mods that change the scale of the UI.
- Colored Notifications, if in use, are now propagated throughout the mod. Some messages will remain uncolored, such as updating/installing/sorting slots - this prevents an issue where other messages get cleared instantly.
- Follower History is now defragmented. This means that if you uninstall a follower mod mid-playthrough (not saying you should but if you do) and they are in history, then existing recorded followers will shift upwards to fill the empty area (and more than one position, if multiple followers are removed). In such cases, new followers that you recruit should always be at the end of the history list. This is mainly an efficiency tweak.
- Followers who are waiting will sneak if the player is sneaking. They may pop back up briefly if asked to wait while the player is sneaking. Also, talking directly to them may cause them to pop back up briefly when they say a goodbye line - for this reason, it is probably best to do this through the Command Followers ability.
- New Command Followers menus show history count in the menu's title area.
- Gifting time (Regard) timing has been increased from a base value of 0.24 (8 hours + random modifier) to a base value of  0.8 (20 hours + random modifier). Gifting was occuring too frequently and should be more along the lines of an occasional gift. New time will take in effect once your current followers give you gifts OR if you dismiss and re-recruit them.
- Followers only give gifts (Regard) when in a city or town location.
- For followers in the Healer Role, you can now disable healing the player, healing self or healing other followers by setting Player Healing Percent, Self Healing Percent or Other Healing Percent to 0.0 in the MCM menu, under System. This affects all Healer Role followers and cannot be set individually at this time.

Fixes
- I made a mistake in causing followers to sheath or unsheath weapons. Not only was it jarring for some people but the correct way to fix the weapon equipping bug seems to be unequipping the weapon and allowing the follower to re-equip it naturally. Weapons are now unequipped on game load for current followers and when recruiting a follower. They aren't "removed" just unequipped but in inventory and the follower will equip them as needed.
-- An example of seeing this in 2.4.6 is to have a follower that uses a 2-handed weapon and also carries a torch at night. If you load a game with this follower under these conditions, they will wind up with the 2-hander equipped in the right hand and the torch in the left. This is erroneous and is a bug that persists (without the fix mentioned) until you trade the weapon back to them.

- Fix for an issue where an item in adventuring gear that you have set up is (basically) indentical to an item that exists in a follower's outfit. The effect would be that the items unequip and re-equip several times over in a row but eventually stop. This should no longer occur.

- Fix for potential wait issues by restructuring how wait is handled slightly. If you have custom followers they "may" be using their own wait/follow routines and therefore follow the 3-day rule (after three days the follower is dimissed). It is best to use the command ability on them for follow/wait instead of dialogue version.
- Optimized Notification messages. Translators please check through the scripts for some string structure changes.

- Revised and Streamlined Bleedout features.
- If using "Disable Bleedout Recovery" then bleedout recovery is enabled temporarily when combat ends, follower is given a slight heal and then bleedout recovery is disabled.
- If using "Revive After Combat" then bleedout is properly checked when combat has ended.
- If bleedout is being stubborn, activating (trying to talk to) the follower also triggers bleedout recovery.
- You can no longer accidentally use potions on a bleedout follower if you are not in combat.

- Streamlined Update Checks on Alias script. If a single update is already registered, the script cannot register a new update until that previous update call is completed. This is a potential spam fix and I am trying to protect your game from script overload.

- Handling Fear (Regard Courage Feature) is now changed. Now using OnMagicEffectApply event to detect MagicInfluenceFear keyword and if found, casts a spell on the follower that cancels fear. Fixes issues with Immersive Wenches/Deadly Wenches since their fear cannot be resisted. This fear protection does have a 2 second cooldown so may not catch all instances - this is required to prevent papyrus stack issues.

- Tweaked detection of friendly targets in combat to include those with a significant Relationship Rank to the Player (3 or higher).

- Optimized handling of actor references on the Alias script.

- Enforce Combat Range requires a follower to not have Use Default Combat checked. This is now reflected in the MCM.

Feature, Favorites
- You can now add followers to a Favorites menu. This is identical to a history menu that you specifically define. You can do the same actions as history: see their current location, move to them or them to you.
- There is room for 25 Favorites.
- You can set up a hotkey for the Favorites menu in the MCM.
- The Favorites menu  can also be found under the Extras menu of the enhanced Command Followers ability. When you open it, it will show how many Favorites are currently used.
- You can add any individual follower in your company (recruited or imported) by using the enhanced Extras menu of the Command Followers Ability when targeting a specific follower. You can also remove them in this area, if they are added.
- You can move any History follower to Favorites by using evoking the History menu by hotkey or the Command Followers menu. You will find the option when selecting a follower from that list.
- You can remove any extisting Favorite Follower, of course.
- This is implemented so that you can keep your own list of followers and don't have to use the history or be concerned as old followers in history drop off of the list.
- When a favorite is added, it is removed from history. When a favorite is removed, it is added back to history if there is enough room.

- Update 2.4.6

Note: New menus will likely come over time. I will not be adding every setting in MCM to a menu, just ones I feel that are often used by most players.

Installer, SkyUILib Installation
- Installer now installs SkyUILib for enhanced menus.

Fixes, MCM
- Fixed an issue where notification of startup messages could not be toggled on or off.
- Configuration Save and Load messages use MCM's show message.
- Show Extra Information (Crafting), toggle no longer blocked on imported followers.
- Fixed several display issues when creating a new base.

Fixes, Aggression Trait
- Fixed an issue where Aggression might not get set back to normal after player has exited stealth (crouch to stand).
- Fixed an issue where Sorting Slots would set Aggression to 0 (to prevent a game bug) but not restore it back to normal.

Fixes, Combat
- Corrected a bug where healers would sometimes not heal teammates. This still has randomness to it but should be more frequent.
- Healers now cache valid heal targets at the start of combat. Faster processing.
- Healing and Taunting interval increased to 6 seconds, up from 4 (reduce spam).
- Taunt detection corrected to be around 1500 units. It was massive because the magic effect area is in feet in CK.
- Taunt effect corrected to be 2048 units or 96 feet.

Fixes, Selling
- Fixed an issue where auto-teleport would bring followers back to you if you set the threshold higher than 1 hour. Note that followers will teleport to a town location withing 25 seconds to fix other issues with some players. Also, travel time to most towns is usually under a couple of hours in-game. This means that you aren't often going to get a lot of milleage from long selling threshold periods. Nothing I can do about this at this time.
- Note: If a follower gets stuck somewhere coming back to you, you should be able to use the Summon ability on them.

Changed, Enforce Combat Range
- Enforce Combat Range is no longer a global setting and is now set on a per-follower basis. Is is Off by default for all followers.
- Enabling this feature only forces the follower to stay with the player if the follower is distant from the player (beyond far range). The enforcement is regardless of the follower's normal combat range.

Improvement, Sneaking
- Improved Stealth AI, Enhance Sneaking and Extinguish Torches when Stealthed are now checked on the follower alias script using the OnPackageStart event.
- Sneak animations on the player now only cause follower packages to be re-evaluated.
- This should be lower impact on game performance while being more accurate.
- Enhance Sneaking and/or Extinguish Torches when Stealthed REQUIRE Improved Stealth AI to be on in the MCM (the MCM also now reflects this).
- There is now a version of Extinguish Torches available on the Command All Followers menu that can be used "on demand", without regard to the above notation.

Improvement, Healer Role Healing
- You can now set a multiplier to reduce or increase the amount of healing done (Heal Magnitude Multiplier). To recap, the full heal amount is 75 + (20% of Healer's Restoration skill) + (their level). A follower at level 20 with 50 restoration would heal: 105 points. Changing the multiplier changes the full calculated amount.

Fixes/Changes, Headwear only in Combat/Never Equip Headwear
- These features have gone through some internal design but should function the same way. Some safety blocks I had in place to prevent stacking have been changed as it caused processing to stop prematurely.
- Head Slotmask detection is improved.
- When toggling Headwear only in Combat on in the MCM and the follower has a helmet or head item, you will be asked if you would like to store that item as the headwear to be stored.
- Trading a head worn item with a follower will update it as the headwear stored. If you wish to change to a different item, you should re-trade that item with them.
- If you have the notification for Headwear Storage active in the MCM, under Notify, it is now reinstated.
- To avoid complications, I recommend that if you are using this feature and Adventuring Gear, to NOT include a head item in the Adventuring Gear.

New, Craftable Hidden Helmet
- You can now craft a new item, Hidden Helmet, under the Leather category in the Smithing Forge. It costs nothing to craft and has negligable weight. It takes up slot 42 (Circlet).
- This is useful for Adventuring Gear. If it is included in Gear setup, then it will block any headwear on an outfit OR traded to the follower.
- If you are using hide headwear features of NFF, the system will try to equip this helmet to help block the follower's helm.

New, Colorized Messages
- Through SkyUILib, many notification messages are shown in color.

Fixes, Gifting
- Gifting simplied to only use dialogue and giving idle animation.
- Follower must be within 1600 units of player, at roughly the same height and not waiting or loading into a cell.

Fixes, Misc
- Potential Expendables now use NFF's follower count instead of game's follower count.
- Fixed an issue where some features might get blocked when recruiting a follower and other followers are sandboxing.
- Reinstated and refined fix for vanilla weapons bug. On game load OR when recruiting follower, they will sheath and draw (or draw then sheath) their weapons, depending on if the player's weapons drawn or not. This refreshes the follower's weapons.
- Followers no longer craft torches when their torches are taken (via menu command) or extinguished.

Tweak, Stripping/Bathing Support
- Adventuring Gear now yields to mods with undressing features.
- It does this by simply checking a few worn item keywords, so it's not foolproof but should work in most cases.
- Now forcing a outfit check when redressing if Adventuring Gear is in use.

Feature, Improved Command All Followers
- New menu system using SkyUILib.
- Navigation: Use the mouse to click menu options. Tab key commits selection.
- (Exit) is placed as the first entry so that you can exit menus quickly.
- It takes a little getting used to but pay attention to what is selected. When you hit Tab that selection is executed. Disregard that the bottom says to use Tab to Exit as some of these menus are "nested" (menu within a menu). No I cannot alter how the menus operate as the library for this is offered "as is" with the caveat that it not be altered.
- Where sensible to do so, I've tried to use ">" as an indicator that there is a submenu.

Command All Followers
- Top level items (All Followers): Wait/Follow (plus put them behind you), Sandbox Toggle, Set Range (Follow or Combat), Set Traits (Aggression, Assistance, Confidence, Morality), Summon All, Show Extras, Switch to Single Follower menu.
- Sandbox Toggle only turns sandbox on or off at this time, no other settings.
- Setting Traits sets them on followers on an individual basis, it doesn't change the global default in the MCM.
- Show Extras includes viewing follower history (with teleport options), Take or Return all Torches (independent of Extinquish Torches) and Sort Slots (just like MCM feature).

Command Single Follower
- Top level items: Show Health/Magicka/Stamina, Do Favor (place into favor mode and is sticky until you press the action button again), Wait/Follower (plus put them behind you), Set Range (Follow, Combat and toggle stay with player in combat), Set Traits (Role, Combat Style, Aggression, Assistance, Confidence, Morality), Set Gear/Inventory (view inventory, set gear, show stored headwear, Undress, Redress), Show Extras (Teach Spell, Shake Follower to fix glitch).
- The Health/Magicka/Stamina line is also "Exit" if clicked/press Tab when selected.
- Show stored headwear only shows the headwear you have set. You cannot change it from this menu at this time.
- Undress strips the followers and puts them into a naked mode where they attempt to stay unclothed. To remove naked mode, simply use Redress.
- Redress dresses a naked follower and refreshes their outfit, if any.
- You can turn on or off helmet management in the headhear submenu of "Set Gear/Inventory". You may need to re-trade a helmet with the follower if turning on only use headwear in combat.

Feature, Show History Menu.
- You can now set a hotkey to show a History menu separate from MCM.
- You can also access it from the Command All Followers ability.
- It takes a few moments for this menu to build as locations are read in real time.
- You can use it to simply see where past followers are or to teleport to them or them to you.

ToDo:
- Add helmet toggle and related toggles to menu.
- Start new game without Sofia installed to check for error.

- Update 2.4.5

Installer, Option to Install Unused Scripts
- From time to time, as warranted or needed, scripts can be removed from the Framework in new versions. This can cause papyrus to cuss and swear as Skyrim will not fully clean out old scripts, even those removed safely (and they are).
- If you are using the framework in an existing game, you can opt to install dummy versions of these removed scripts to keep papyrus free of errors. However, if you like to clean your saves with ReSaver or a similar utility, you do not need to install the dummy scripts as it will removed these unused instances.
- If you are installing the framework into a new game, you do not need to check this option.
- It will technically not hurt anything if you ignore this option and do not install the dummy scripts.

Removal, Brawling/Sparring
- Completely removed the brawling system from the framework. It is just too problematic to get correct, especially when other mods are involved. This is not anyone else's fault, it's my fault for not getting it to work right.
- Removed cleanly from the system, further cleaning with xEdit 4.02.
- In Papyrus you will get some messages that end "This variable will be skipped.". This is normal and will not persist in future saves.
- Concerning ReSaver (or similar save cleaners), see the installer option notes above.
- On the upside, removed several scripts and some dead weight from the mod.

Changes, AI Packages
- Removed the large, custom follow package that was previously in place for several small condition-based packages.
- Reduces (but does not remove) the amount of unusual follower behavior, such as running in place and colliding into objects that are caused by custom packages.

Fixes, Gifting
- Gifting is now handled simarly to Selling in terms of how the quest and aliases are handled. This should work better in most cases. Gifting followers ignore combat and are protected while gifting (they can't gift while in combat already). Gifting faction is depreciated.
- Gifting quest is cleared on game load in the event it gets stuck.
- Prior to giving you a gift, a message will appear "X has something for you." to let you know what is going on.
- Gifting now has a 15-second timeout. If the follower doesn't reach you and give a gift within this time, the related quest is stopped and they will try later.

Fixes, Crafting
- Multiple tweaks applied to crafting so that multiple followers are handled better. All followers should craft when able to, if sandboxing is active.

Fixes, Selling
- You can now sell all items, including magic items.
- Selling now uses the Gift interface instead of the Trading interface. Due to how this interface works, once you give them something, you cannot take it back, so take your time. It is the only interface that can pass actual item values to a script.
- Target destination is now set to the center marker of the town instead of the center marker of the store. This should allow followers to sell without accidentally causing a bounty.
- Selling now has an exterior cell timeout of 25 seconds. When this threshold is reached, they will be teleported to the target destination.
- Summon Followers now works on a selling follower that is trying to get back to the player.
- If there are still items in the "to be sold" container when loading a save, those items will be returned to the player and the selling system reset. This should fix a reported glitch, though I haven't had it happen in game. Make sure sales are complete, if you can, before saving a game and exiting for the evening.
- Addition check that gives gold to the player if selling is stuck, when starting a new sale.

Fixes, Minions
- Minions are now only auto cleared if dead/not loaded/marked for dead.
- Fixed an issue where reanimated minions weren't given extra time for detection (the reanimating effect can be very long).
- Increased range to 1600 units when trying to acquire minions (mainly for fast-moving minions).

Fixes, MCM Menu
- Fixed erroneous display of individual Sandbox toggle. Would seem to uncheck itself but it wasn't refreshing.
- Changing Sandbox settings now forces evaluation of packages when exiting the MCM.
- Remove NPC debug option changed. Renamed to Purge NPC to avoid now thoroughly attempts to clear out a stuck follower and can attempt to reset other followers. When you use this function, you are now asked if it is a standard follower, expendable or import via a menu and it will proceed from there. Functions near identical to dismiss or export via dialogue but forces npcs out of key framework factions.
- An unsupported class now shows the name of the class in parenthesis, rather than "Custom".
- "Use Default Combat" no longer prevents a follower from being a Healer.
- "Use Default Combat" doesn't prevent Tank or Healer Role, so the description in the MCM was corrected.
- Optimized some MCM display, depending on choices. Home Bases still needs a slight overhaul (in progress).

Fixes, Misc
- Support for a Follower's "Display Name" in all aspects of the mod. Essentially, the mod now tries to find the name of a Follower based on the name displayed in game. If not found, uses the name of the Follower's Actor Base. This supports quests that change the name of an actor.
- Added "Follower in Scene" (must be false) condition to Avoidance.
- Fixed an issue where Regard increase messages would not be displayed.
- Hirelings added to comment faction ("Look Over There!", "Be careful", etc).
- Followers in Framework travel packages will opt more to run instead of walk when at a higher or lower elevation than their target (Affects crafting as well).
- Fixed a couple of issues handling dead actors when follower is looking for hostile target.
- Attempt to clarify some of the Import/Export language used. Import is now shown as "[Add to Framework (Import)]". Export is shown as "[Remove from Framework (Export)]".
- Fixed an issue where Followers would not do idle chatter, if enabled.
- Tweaked Adventuring Gear outfit equipping. It seems that some items/actors can become very stubborn so the system will attempt to unequip briefly and equip if an item isn't equipped.
- Summon Followers no longer works while followers are being managed by Convenient Horses. This mainly keeps auto-Teleport from constantly teleporting a follower to you when they are buying a horse.
- No Player Damage to Teammates only activates when the player is attacking. This means that weapon display should no longer show 0 damage unless you are attacking.
- Some script properties were optimized.
- Reoptimized main esp with xEdit 4.0.2.

Feature, Enforce Combat Range
- Followers can be partially forced to stay in proximity to the player, according to their combat range.
- This fixes issues where followers may wander fairly far from the player in combat or be feared or similar and not return to the area.
- This helps with issues where the player is in a larger room of a dungeon and followers are stuck in a hallway or corridor, mainly because a caster or archer is blocking everyone.
- It also works with captured minions (like flame atronachs blocking areas).
- It does not work if using Use Default Combat on a follower.
- This feature doesn't work flawlessly. It also has a bit of random chance to it. It is skipped if the follower is attacking or casting a spell so that it isn't distruptive.
- It uses the travel to procedure so occasionally followers may kind of appear near the player (hop short distances).

Feature, All Followers Behind You
- Can be hotkeyed and also can be used in the command followers ability.
- All followers in a short range around  the player will be placed behind the player.

Feature, Player Interaction
- Some player actions will prompt followers to comment. Currently player leveling and crafting items at the forge are supported.
- You can toggle this off in the MCM or for individual followers (under Tweaks).
- All Vanilla-voiced followers (including RDO expanded vanilla voices), Serana and Frea have a chance to congratulate the player on leveling or generally be impressed. Up to 5 followers can comment and the number is random. Followers need to be within 1200 units to comment.
- Many, but not all, Vanilla-voiced followers (blacksmith voices plus some additional female voices), Serana or Frea may comment when the player is crafting armor or weapons (Smithing skill must be 30 or higher). There is a 25% chance that one follower will comment. Only occurs if the follower is within 1200 units and only once per 15 minutes game time.
- These are story event driven and script-free.

Features, Misc
- Under Wealth options in the MCM, you can now set followers to not receive gold in their inventory from NFF cost features.
- If you have modified skills via NFF and they are different from the skills displayed on the actor's base (including calculations from leveling), they will be shown in blue text. When you go into edit mode, you will be the original value followed by the modified value. I noted that changing class of a follower would re-adjust modified skills - I was in error.


- Update 2.4.4

Changes, Follower Combat
- Added check for get parent cell and also check if cell is loaded before casting taunt or healing. Fixes occasional papyrus log error.
- Added additional hostility check to OnHit. Also added to captured Minions.
- Follower aggression is not reinforced during combat. In some cases, it was causing issues.

Changes, Candlelight
- You can now set the global Candlelight setting for all followers, as before, but an option to not cast is available.
- You can set Candlelight style, including setting it off, for any individual follower under Tweaks. If you do not specifically set the style for a follower, they will use the global setting.
- Both of these setting work independently of each other. Example, if you set off support globally, but set it to soft cold on one follower, that follower will cast Candlelight when conditions are appropriate.

Fixes/Changes, Crafting
- Being in console, loading screen or in a game menu now pauses crafting instead of accidentally stopping it.
- Individual crafting quests furniture aliases are now linked to the object awareness quest furniture aliases. Fixes an issue where follower would be out of range of a crafting station and the player would be in range and this would cause crafting to be blocked.
- Some crafting flags now reset to false on player cell load (with loading screen).
- Crafting time left, in hours can now be shown in the MCM menu in Follower Tweaks, beneath each crafting toggle. Only shows if it is enabled for that follower. This allows you to know exactly when crafting will occur for any specific follower.

Fixes/Changes, Minion Capture
- Minions are cleared on game load and cell change.
- Minion is cleared when it's 3D is unloaded.
- Reduced detection radius around caster from 2048 to 1280.
- Reanimating spells (having the keyword MagicSummonUndead) have a longer delay before detection.
- You can set summoned minions (in the MCM, enabled by default) to follow the player outside of combat. This fixes an issue where a minion may get struck accidentally by the player or followers and just stand there. It is possible that this will cause "false positive" captures to follow the player as well.
- Raised minions quest priority.

Fixes, Misc
- Recommend Gear Storage now functions properly. There was an issue where a storage slot would be assigned but recorded before gear items were applied instead of after it, causing storage of 0 gear pieces. Changing gear around (using set gear again) functions normally, so if you switched gear after, you didn't see this bug.
- Fixed an issue where disable weapon draw toggle is not applied immediately.
- Followers are now checked if they are on horseback when combat starts and they should match the player's state (horseback, not on horseback, etc).
- No Player Damage to Teammates setting no longer affects J'zargo's scrolls.
- ESL flag removed from optional LE spell esps, just in case there may be issues.
- Corrected some visual issues when using Debug to set a NPC as a follower or marriage candidate.
- If a follower is selling items and in an interior cell, they will be teleported out after 10 seconds. This should help with Followers that are having trouble exiting interiors.
- Sped up home bases display in the MCM. First time a display is loaded, it is cached. If you change bases in the display or make any change to the base, it will be re-cached (takes a moment).
- Since I recently found out that array lengths can be embedded in save files, MCM arrays (menu items) are now generated upon NFF's MCM load. This should have no performance impact, just a workaround.
- Added more strings to the language files, mainly from nwsFollowerMCMScript, nwsFollowerControllerScript.
- Eligibility for Changing Follower to Essential or Non-Essential (under Tweaks, Protection) is now made more clear if disabled.
- Added slight additional delay for mounting/dismounting if using NFF's horse features.

- Update 2.4.3

Fixes:
- Tracking Followers can now be activated/toggled in the MCM.
- Stats can be Edited again in the MCM.
- Followers no longer cast Candlelight while the player is sneaking.

Changes, Dismiss:
- Decided to split the dismiss message into 2 lines if the follower is assigned to a home base. Way too much text for the length of some names.

Changes, Follower Combat
- Reduced Infighting now uses controlled OnHit event with anti-spam protection (to keep huge number of hit events to be checked against).
- Reduced Infighting acquiring new target is simplified. Acquiring a target shouldn't happen often in most cases.
- Checking combat state (combat, not in combat, searching) used for doing activities on exiting combat (check for recharge, remove helmet, etc).
- Checking combat state for aggression and roles only. Reduces load, fixes some issues where followers do not fight.
- Followers no longer do activities during search phase of combat.
- Followers with Regard-based Courage are now more likely to remove fear effects.
- Tank, adjust ranges on detect enemy and taunt (now 2048, they were uneven prior).

Changes, Minions
- Captured minions now ignore non-hostile spells for hit events.

Changes, Healer Role
- You are always notified if a follower is healed if notifications are on when a follower heals another follower.
- Improved chance of follower saying thanks when healed.

Features:
- Okay for the crazy and adventurous, you can now set a target NPC to be a follower and/or marriage candidate.
-- Put an NPC under the game crosshair, where you see their name come up.
-- Go to the system tab of NFF's MCM and scroll all the way down. You should see "Force to Follower". Click it. Exit the MCM menus.
-- If the NPC has a voice that is a legitimate follower voice in Skyrim or in RDO (if you have it installed), they can now become a follower.
-- If the NPC has a voice that is a legitimate marriage voice in Skyrim or in RDO (if you have it installed), they can now be married.
-- Yes, this can break game quests if you don't know what you are doing.  It's a good idea to google specific npcs beforehand to see if there are critical quests tied to them, which you should complete before messing around with them.

- Update 2.4.2

Notation:
- I recently observed behavior where saving very quickly at the start of a game could cause an issue where the current state of the script is not fully stored in a save file. Be sure to allow a few seconds after loading your game before you save. This is not a framework issue, per se. It can happen with any script that is doing things upon game load.
- NFF's main esp for SSE will not be ESL flagged at any point. Would cause changes to record IDs and I need those compatible with Skyrim LE for conversion.

Changes, Installer:
- Now using Universal Installer (SSE/LE) as main download.
- Changed behavior of installer to allow choice between SSE and LE without disabling anything initially. This is to reduce confusion when installing with Vortex/MO.
- When you select between SSE and LE, only options for that particular version of Skyrim will be shown.

Fixes, Misc:
- Fixed an error in Papyrus when attempting to get the ID of a "None" Quest.
- Condition added to follower packages to make sure actor 3d is loaded before doing anything package-based. Stability tweak.
- Player Alias script now stops sandboxing/interaction when changing locations, rather than using follower alias. Stability tweak.
- Sandbox/Crafting is now restarted more safely.
- Followers no longer check Charge, Regard or Affinity features when changing locations.
- Check Follower Count process is now further optimized.
- "No Bleedout Recovery" is now set to False when dismissing/exporting a follower. It will be reapplied, if needed, when recruting/importing them.
- The main controler script and the mcm are getting rather large so I've split them each into 2 smaller scripts.
-- Some functions of nwsFollowerControllerScript (the workhorse) are being offloaded to a helper script. Functions that were moved are redirected so you don't lose 3rd party mod support.
-- nwsFollowerMCMscript backend functions are offloaded to another helper script. These are things like text changing on highlight, processing selections and so on.
-- You shouldn't notice any effect from this. It is just "behind the scenes" manipulation. You will get papyrus warnings on an existing save that quite a few variables were "removed". This is normal and only happens on saves prior to this update.
- Fixed an issue where non-unison sandboxing checks would block other checks when entering a new location/cell.

Changes, Candlelight:
- Dispelling light no longer uses casting animations. Fixes jittering look.
- For dispelling light upon player sneaking, you will need to have Extinguish Torches or Enhanced Stealth active since it activates on certain animations.
- Felt that the new candlelight versions are still too bright with too much haze, so lowered the brightness on the light component and the opacity of the haze effect.

New, No Player Damage to Teammates
- New option in the Combat section, below Reduce Infighting. This adds a perk to the player that is similar to the Dragonborn DLC's black book effect where teammates are not damaged. Player's destruction spells, weapon-based attacks and shouts (except Unrelenting Force) will have no affect on followers or teammates.
- Only takes effect while the player has weapons/spell/fists raised. While this condition is true, weapons will show no damage in your inventory (side-effect, sheath to return display to normal).
- Only affects teammates and followers that are not hostile to the player.
- Also extends to not affecting Minions, if Minion Support is enabled.

New, Minion Support
- The Framework will attempt to check for Conjured/Summoned/Reanimated Minions cast by followers and reduce infighting between followers/player/minions.
- Checks when a follower casts Summoning and scans a large radius around the summoner. Can detect up to 5 minions at one time.
- If a minion is detected, it is added to a quest alias to stop infighting. The alias adds no packages, only framework faction and attaches a small script. Up to 10 minions maximum are supported.
- When minions die/despawn they are removed from framework observation.
- Minions are not affected by player/follower/teammate damaging spells if using NTMD.
- Any kind of system for affecting summoned creatures is tricky at best. It looks for controlled creatures near the summoner that are not in the framework faction and not hostile to the player. It can pick up minions that are non-hostile and were cast by guards or other NPCs. It attempts to get minions close to the player first. It doesn't put them into any packages though, so they won't follow you.
- It is toggled in the MCM.
- You can be notified when minions are added via a new Notifications option in the MCM.
- If you strike a minion outside of combat with a weapon or shield, they might just stand there and stop following, unless you are using No Player Damage to Teammates, above.
- It may never reach a point where it is 100% accurate but it is better than no support at all.

Changes, Wait along with Summon
- You can now summon waiting followers (on demand summon only). Is activated in the MCM.
- Will give you a dialogue, per waiting follower, if active.

New, Support for Mechanical Followers
- Now gives same "pet" support as Animals to Mechanicals that can be obtained in Dragonborn.
- They can sell things, be assigned home base and so on.
- They have some voiced "hiss" dialogues.

Changes, No Team Magic Damage
- In SSE, the esp is flagged as an esl. Doesn't take up a mod slot. You're welcome.
- Added option to cause Unrelenting Force to affect followers if using NTMD.
- NTMD now affects minion spells.
- NTMD now affects Vanilla/Dawnguard/Dragonborn magic staves used by Follower/Player/Teammates.

Changes, NTMD for Apocalypse
- In SSE, the esp is flagged as an esl. Doesn't take up a mod slot. You're welcome.
- Apocalyspe destructions staves are supported.

New, Support for Elemental Destruction Magic
- Optional NTMD patch for Elemental Destruction Magic
- In SSE, the esp is flagged as an esl. Doesn't take up a mod slot. You're welcome.
- For LE, ONLY supports the Perks version of this mod as it is the most complete.

- Update 2.4.1

Fixes, Adventuring Gear
- When applying Adventuring Gear, Leveled Items can now be affected. This applies to the items you designate as gear items as well as Outfit Items that come with a follower.
- What this means is that in the game, gear is generated in one of two ways: Single Items or Items that are part of a list of possible items that is randomly determined. NFF now checks into those lists to see if any possible generated item is being worn by a follower.
- This is a big deal as there should be less issues with setting gear overall. A good example of problem followers would be mages that are part of Winterhold College.
- Currently, there is a limitation that NFF only checks the top level of a leveled item list, so it won't detect item lists inside of item lists. This shouldn't be common in regards to armor and clothing.

Fixes, Bleedout:
- Revive After Combat should now work if Disable Bleedout Recovery is enabled.
- Potion Recovery should now work if Disable Bleedout Recovery is enabled.
- If Disable Bleedout Recovery is enabled you CANNOT use healing spells on them. There's no hit event to detect incoming spells and no plans to use that event because it is spammy.

Fixes, Combat:
- Remove "Guard" behavior from healer/tank as it could cause the follower to not attack.
- Healer/Tank role followers will instead travel to the player if he is reasonably hurt.

Fixes, Difficulty:
- Fixed an issue where incoming or outcoming damage might be set to 0.0 upon first game load, if you have set the player difficulty override in the MCM.

Fixes, Eloping:
- Dialogue changed to where the player can confirm choice to elope.
- Elope issue resolved where married follower might be stuck in a vanilla greet package.
- Note: You will have to use the move somewhere dialogue (if available) to move your spouse. If the dialogue is not present then either you do not have a vanilla/heartfires home or your spouse doesn't have an original home marked as a dwelling. You can still use NFF's Home Bases to place the spouse somewhere, if nothing else works. You should still receive lover's comfort buff and store features regardless.

Fixes, History:
- Fixed some issues with the history display on the Slots page.

Fixes, Perks:
- Corrected Stealth Tiers display in the MCM.
- Support for Vokrii naming display in the MCM. (Translators be aware that nwsFollowerPerkScript has changed)

Fixes, Quests:
- Followers will no longer sandbox or craft during Roggvir's execution in Solitude.
- Will look into other situations where followers go to Oblivion and so on in the future.

Fixes, Selling/Equipping Action
- Now using SKSE menu close event for handling containers closing.

Fixes, Shield Use
- This option now disregards the shield that comes as part of a follower's outfit. An example in vanilla Skyrim are the housecarls. This is done to prevent and issue where you give them a different shield and they are not sure which to use, causing the game to flip between the two shields.
- This fix may not be 100%.

Fixes, Waiting:
- Followers will now sandbox while waiting in a very small radius (128 units) if in a dungeon interior/exterior.  Otherwise, they will sandbox while waiting in a moderately large radius (1024 units).
- In the MCM, under Movement on first page, you can set followers to Wait and never sandbox. If enabled, they will just stand there and not move, regardless of location (and notes above). Changes to followers that are currently waiting will be applied within a few seconds.
- In the MCM, under Movement on first page, you can set followers to Wait Forever. The normal time in Skyrim allowed for waiting is 3 days, after which the follower will leave your service. You can change this to indefinite. This may not have any effect on followers with their own built-in wait/follow commands that are outside of the vanilla dialogue system. You may need to ask followers to wait again if you change this setting.
- Choice of Wait type is now removed from the the Command Followers power in lieu of the changes, above.

Fixes, Misc:
- Fixed display in MCM for followers that can't be set to essential and the item is greyed out but also checked. They were never set essential, it's a visual bug.
- Updated variable to attempt to trigger missing tab entries for some users.

Changes, Sandboxing:
- Followers no longer start sandboxing in unison. There is a slight, random delay between individuals. This should feel more lifelike when sandboxing begins.
- Followers now must be relatively close to the player before sandboxing. After sandboxing starts, they will wander/move according to the range you have set in the MCM.
- New Option to Stop Sandboxing while the Player is in dialogue-based conversations. Simulates followers paying attention to conversations.

New, Candlelight:
- Followers who have the candlelight spell (normally they don't but you can teach it to them via other options in this mod) will now cast candlelight in dungeons if illumination is low (under 40 in the game's rating) or in exteriors if at night time.
- Will dispel candlelight when player is stealthing/crouched or is in interior that is not a dungeon.
- Should work with mods that modify Candlelight effects.
- Candlelight when cast by a follower lasts 3 minutes in game time.
- You can select between the standard (bright) visual or one of 3 alternative soft colors in the MCM menu, under Gameplay. Variations include Cold, Warm or Neutral.
- Quirk: Sometimes the light part gets left behind, especially when using the wait menu.
- Quirk: Followers may jitter when casting/dispelling light.

New, Remove Spells
- You can now remove granted spells from followers. You will receive a confirmation dialogue when trying to remove any spell. Be VERY CAREFUL with this and do not remove spells that are granted via features that might be contained in that follower if it is a mod. You cannot remove spells that are part of a follower's Perk effects (these are usually zero cost spells).

New, Teach Spells Dialogue
- You can now teach spells to a follower via dialogue, if that Gameplay option is enabled. Shows under NFF's submenu but only if the player has a spell equipped.

New, No Team Magic Damage
- OPTIONAL Separate Download.
- Requires Dragonborn to be active in your load order.
- Destruction spell damage no longer affects the player, followers or teammates if cast from the player, followers or teammates.
- Affects Dragonborn Destruction spells and spells changed by Dragonborn.
- Affects Damaging Shouts and Unrelenting Force.
- Does include USLEEP/USSEP spell changes.
- Currently no support for minions/conjured creatures.
- Not compatible with mods that affect vanilla spells (changing their cost/magnitude/duration). Is compatible with mods that alter existing spell effects.
- No effect on new destruction spells added by follower mods or spell mods.
- Don't ask me to patch X or Y mod. I may look at larger, frequently used mods in the future. However, you can patch them if you'd like, by examining my conditions added to destruction spell forms.

- Update 2.4.0

Notes:
- ConsoleUtil support is now functional.
- ConsoleUtil support must now be turned on in the MCM near the bottom of the System page. This eliminated papyrus errors, if off, for those that don't wish to install ConsoleUtilSSE or ConsoleUtil.
- Could be some interactions between Disabling Bleedout Recovery and Using Potions to Revive them in combat. Disable Bleedout changes a game setting and using potions should restore health to remove them from bleedout. However, the game may bug out if you are asking it to turn off recovery and then are using some other means to recover them. This is being investigated.
- I recommend that you leave Allow Empty Gear unticked in the MCM for the moment. I'm looking at some possible issues with it.
- Known issue: Starting or finishing a Miscellaneous quest will turn on follower tracking if it is enabled.

Fixes, General:
- Added addition conditions to some scripts to skip their checking if in the console or in a loading screen. Extra safety layer.
- Fix for missing script causing consoleUtil papyrus error.
- Set some voiced dialogue bits to only include vanilla follower voices (including non-unique voices from RDO). Minor fix.
- Corrected some bad description text in the MCM.
- Some minor script corrections related to USSEP/USLEEP. Thanks to dldrzz00 for pointing out the differences. No effect if not using USSEP/USLEEP.
- Fixed an issue where Regard gifting could be delayed indefinitely when you have multiple followers.

Fixes, Language/Translation:
- Skill names are now drawn from the language file and can be translated.
- Resistances names are now drawn from the language file and can be translated.
- Now using language string for invalid outfit item warning.
- Language file is used for warning on trading enchanted weapons/armor to selling follower.
- Notated in MCM that teleporting followers allows them in places that followers cannot normally go to. Examples: Apocrypha, Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary, etc. In Skyrim, these areas are restricted via doors and teleport bypasses doors, walls and everything else. You can turn off Catch-Up and only use it on demand, make followers wait until you are finished with an area or not have them with you for certain portions of the game.
- Some Language strings changed and added under Debug.
- Some Dialogue moved internally under Subtopic.
- Level up message added if using Leveling feature.

Fixes, Combat:
- Weapon recharging is now more consistent. 25% of checking weapon charge when exiting combat.
- Bows can now be recharged after combat.
- Fixed an issue where trying to find a valid target on a dead actor would cause an error.

Fixes, Non-combat:
- Corrected an issue where Healer follower would not use their healing package outside of combat (on self or the player). Doesn't apply to animal healers.
- Fixed an issue where followers had a delay in following when the player moves into a new space/cell.
- Smoothed out various states when a follower is following the player (walk, run, etc.). This is automatically done on the following package.
- Tweaked Follow Range procedures. No ranges were reduced.
- Fixed an issue where traveling to give a gift to the player was at walking speed, even at large distances.
- When a follower is dismissed and is wearing adventuring gear, the gear is now unequipped. This prevents a visual game bug where followers might not be wearing pants (or similar) if that item uses a slot other than 32.

Fixes, Selling:
- Critical fix for Sell Items and Set Gear for Skyrim Legendary Edition. Should now block execution of script while in a container or Console is open. New method also works in SSE.
- When selling items, you can no longer give followers magical weapons or armor to sell. There is an issue where the gold value of the these items reflects the base form not the enchanted one (as if the follower is selling the non-enchanted version). You can still sell spellbooks, scrolls and those kinds of items. The notation in the CK wiki was not clear enough because pre-enchanted items are unique forms but this does not matter. Sorry, just don't think you want to sell a staff valued at 2000 gold for 5 gold.
- If items were not successfully sold before, those items are now returned to the player's inventory prior to opening the selling container.
- When using a follower to sell, gold total is calculated in a new function rather than as items are traded. This is safer but delays start up of the selling process.
- Fixed an issue where sale locations may be erroneously calculated.

Fixes, Sandboxing:
- Followers no longer attempt to sandbox in the delay between selling or equipping actions.
- Changing sandboxing options in the MCM will now reset sandboxing activity.
- Sandboxing package now should better re-evaluate to have followers gradually move to near the player's position if still in sandbox mode.

Improvements:
- Added some voice variety in some NFF added dialogue (42 voices supported plus Frea and Serana).
- Frea (Dragonborn) now has voiced Tavern dialogue.
- Frea now has Shared Loot dialogue.
- Dismiss and heading to a home base are now displayed in a single message.
- Version information is now displayed according to actual mod version (2.4.0 versus 2.40). You can check the version, in game, in the MCM slots page.
- Tank Role followers will now guard the player if he is low on health (move in and defend from attackers if the tank has no target). For now, this happens if player's health is under 60%.
- Healer Role followers now guard the player if health is under the player's healing threshold.
- Follower Attack Damage multiplier allows for finer adjustments.
- On the system page, under debug, you can now see the topmost AI package (in hex) running on a targetted NPC, along with any scene quest that is running on them.

Features:
- Followers can be set to not sandbox furniture (interactable objects). They will still use idle markers if this option is enabled.
- You can now set the Healing or Taunting check chance for followers in one of those roles. This is the chance, every 4 seconds, that a follower will look at conditions for doing one of these. Cooldown is still a factor regarding taunts. The chance for healing is intially 75%, for taunting it's 100%.
- You can now adjust the damage dealt by the player and damage the player receives on the current game difficulty. You can set values from 0.25 to 10.0. If you change difficulties in-game, you will have to re-tweak these values. This feature has no effect if not enabled, if you are using a different mod to tweak this. This is somewhat outside of the realm of a follower manager but I personally wanted a way to tweak this in a simple way, on the fly, without having to tweak every difficulty level. Not sure if this has an detrimental effect on CC Survival Mode, which I don't have. If you disable the feature, game values are restored.
- You can now Elope with a follower, which can be enabled in the MCM under Quests. This is a fast-track marriage option for eligible NPCs without having to do the whole Riften/Temple of Mara/Amulet of Mara bit. Eligible means they must be marryable. It's for folks who have issues with the marriage quest or just don't want to go through all of that. You should talk to your spouse immediately after and set where you want them to live by using "I want you to move somewhere else", if you want to go that route.

- Update 2.3.9

Fixes:
- Reverted to 2.3.6 core concerning how followers are added and managed. Removed cache system and is now again read directly from DialogueFollower aliases. So this is identical to 2.3.6 on the back end with except of some variables being loaded from the variable quest (which was already present in 2.3.6). Tested on multiple games from scratch. Tested on existing game at multiple points, upgrading from different versions. Error checked with xEdit. Papyrus error checked.
- No longer flushing slots on a new installation of NFF in a brand new game. Doesn't need to be done. Lowers stress when a new game is started with many mods in place. Possibly removes a script stacking issue.
- Updating/Ready messages should be more logically placed.
- Corrected erroneous description in the MCM.
- Utility functions in dialogues are enabled by default in a new game. You can turn them off, of course. Includes get behind me and snap out of it type extras.
- Added a little randomness to Healer Roll healing. It's a bit too efficient now because we don't have the package delay. 75% chance to check for heal. It will be adjustable in the future.

Tweaks:
- Set Alpha value now starts at 1.0 on a fresh game, so that followers don't look transparent. You can still adjust this. Too many people don't know that this is a visual cue for stealth enhancement.

- Update 2.3.8

Fixes:
- An issue with stopping the DialogueFollower quest upon starting a new game was fixed. This quest is no longer shut down.

Tweaks:
- Waiting followers are limited to a much smaller sandbox radius (256) and will no longer interact with furniture (or levers).

- Update 2.3.7

Notes:
- I gave the wrong information regarding Health, Magicka, Stamina and Stat editing. It appears that changes are permanent as the current value is modified instead of setting the base value. Wording in MCM is changed to reflect this.

Fixes:
- Followers no longer refuse to sandbox if in a perpetual scene (Sofia).
- Interactive Gearing is removed. Basically, that's enough of that business. This means that all the interaction issues are gone.
- Reset Framework debug option was reworked. It hadn't been updated in a while and activating it caused CTD. It now flushes all followers from the framework and resets the dialogue follower quest.
- String issue fixed in MCM.
- Fixed an issue where Sandboxing might not normally activate.
- Fixed a bug where Follower Tracking would become active if you had toggled it off and recruited a follower.
- Added some some variables to the Save/Load Configuration function.
- Fixed an issue where selling item alias script would try to initialize if the quest isn't running.
- Selling process now manually starts scene. Added time check correction.

Improvements:
- Added Falkreath and Winterhold to selling locations for Sell Items.
- Healer role is no longer package based when it comes to combat healing. Now runs as a script function, similar to tank role. Healing checks are made every 4 seconds and given enough magicka, will cast a heal other if needed. Can affect player, self and followers. Healing out of combat is still package-based at this time.
- Healer role further tweaks/balancing: NFF's Heal Other no longer has a casting cooldown (doesn't need it with the scripted component). Healing is affected by Restoration Adept Perk (50% cost). Healing can now use Stamina as a reserve if the follower has no mana left (cost 50 stamina). This means that you can also use followers with high Stamina as healers because they can just draw from inner strength/power. Animals are now no longer restricted from Healer role as well, as long as they have the minimum stamina to cast one heal (50). This is not particularly lore-friendly but allows flexibility. Yes, this does allow animals to also heal themselves. Animals cannot heal out of combat.
- Tank Role rebalanced: Taunting now costs 30 Stamina (up from 15, with no cost when first entering combat). Requirements for Tank role reduced to minimum 30 Stamina.
- Dialogues area of the MCM split into Dialogue (Situational, Main menu), Dialogue ("I need a moment of your time. (NFF)" menu), and Confirmations (which weren't really dialogues).
- If you choose one or more "Just a moment" dialogue options, it will show up in a submenu near the end of the main menu.  Vanilla-Style options, situational options and import/export remain on the main dialogue tree.
- Sell Items is enabled by default.
- Followers are now more likely to reduce friendly fire when it comes to non-hostile summoned minions. Requires Reduce Infighting (MCM) to be enabled.
- Followers, slot positions and aliases are now cached into small arrays instead of retrieving them from the dialogue follower quest. This streamlines processing on multiple scripts as well as all multi-follower functions. Some of this improvement is in progress. Be aware that "This variable will be skipped." messages in papryus log are normal and stop on future game/save loads.
- Number of Properties stored on alias scripts is reduced.
- When a follower in the healer role heals another follower, there is a notification. Can be turned off in the MCM.

Features:
- Added ConsoleUtil support, allowing new features in the Framework and cleaner operation of others. NFF will still function without ConsoleUtil, a detection system is implemented. I cannot change required version of SKSE64 for consoleutil, it is beyond my control.
-- For Skyrim Special Edition, consoleutil requires SKSE 64 for 1.5.73 or 1.5.80 and is available at https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24858
-- For Skyrim it is available at https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/66257
-- Papyrus will show an error when checking for ConsoleUtil, if it is not installed. This is unavoidable but can be ignored.

- You can now raise followers level to that of the player from the MCM panel by clicking on their level on the Stats page. Must be in Edit mode. REQUIRES CONSOLEUTIL. Same function as the nfflevel bat file. Followers will now level with no cap with the player (also chaged on nfflevel bat file).
- New scripted healing is handled by consoleutil, if installed. This allows casting animations. Animals never receive casting animations.
- You can now hotkey Trade command with a follower.
- You can now hotkey Toggling between Wait and Follow on all followers.
- You can now set the maximum time a follower can take when selling items for the player. This is under "Sell Items Threshold" in the Actions section (Gameplay page) of the MCM. You can set from 1 hour to 72 hours. This doesn't mean the follower will always take an hour or more, just that they will not go over this in game time.
- Added a "Snap Out of It" option in dialogue (in the MCM, on the quest page) that can help with animation glitches on a follower, like running in place or switching direction sporadically. This often comes from using custom AI packages, which this mod makes use of. Using the Calm Followers ability will apply this to all followers.

- Update 2.3.6

- Advised update procedure: Uninstall the old one, immediately install the new one. Play.

- Mod changes are now checked in xEdit 4.0.2. Was checking in earlier versions as well, just a friendly reminder that this mod is error-checked.
- Reduced number of variables required for MCM settings, most changed to small arrays.
- Language String files are now used for dialogue prompts (what the player says). Follower responses cannot be replaced with a string, so those remain. Cannot replace dialogue with prices.
- Re-designed how Interactive Gearing and those scenes play out in game due to numerous random issues. Instead, it is split into two scenes, one is moving to the player, one is thanking the player. This seems granual in approach but those scenes can be re-used in other future features because they are not specifically designed just for Interactive Gearing. Using scenes to override any alias packages, as scenes have priority. Now, there should be no issue with the scenes hanging as they are single fire and short. Also, even scene-breaker is in place. This is similar to earlier versions of the tavern scene breaking. Many other small issues fixed.
- Turned off Intractive Gearing by default. No change in existing game.
- Recommend Gear Storage, where the mod asks if you'd like to store Adventuring Gear in an available slot, is now optional and disabled by default. Can be toggled in the MCM, under Crafting/Interaction. You can still do this manually in MCM.
- Allow Empty Gear, which previously showed a dialogue with this option if the list of Gear is empty, is now option. If disabled (now the default), this feature is no longer offered. Can be toggled in the MCM, under Crafting/Interaction. This also disables the ability to automatically remove storage (you can still do this manually in MCM).
- Removed nwsFollower_ModelingEquip script from installation.
- Followers should no longer be erroneously removed from protected status upon load.
- 3DNPC followers are now added to the bard audience excluded faction when recruited. If your 3DNPC follower suddenly wandered off and was not specifically in a 3DNPC quest, this is probably the reason.
- Follower History checking and building now runs at load time (in another process) and is offloaded from running on the MCM script.
- Crafting/Tavern checks now skip followers in dialogue with the player.
- Relax Avoidance Distance default reduced to 45.0 (down from 120.0). No effect on existing game.
- Made an attempt to revive followers from bleedout if "Revive After Combat" or "Disable Bleedout Recovery" is enabled and something hurts the follower outside of combat (i.e. traps). Trying to control bleedout is very touchy at best, not sure if this will help.
- Most dialogues from NFF that lead to the system "doing something" are given a remote call so that the menu doesn't hang open the whole time. The update time has been reduced from 0.5 seconds to 0.2, enough to just close the menu. People may perceive a slight delay as "it did nothing" or it's "lagging" but this by design.
- All dialogue fragments are now run directly rather than using a sharedsilence continue. I hope this resolves a bunch of issues (that I never experienced here) like trading with expendables, adventuring gear dialogue, most new dialogues added by NFF.
- You can now set Sandboxing Autobox to automatically sandbox in exteriors, toggled in the MCM. Only relevant if you have Autobox in Town or Home enabled. This may catch areas just on the edge of towns, be warned.

- Feature: You can now ask a follower to sell items for you. This is activated by dialogue, hotkey or the Command Followers power (targetted follower). Set these in the MCM. A trading window will appear. Place any items you wish to sell in the "Items to sell" side (Avoid using the "R" key at all here). After the window is closed, the follower will leave to sell things.
-- Followers will attempt to choose the closest location of one of 6 stores in major areas of Skyrim, if outside. In interiors, they will attempt to find the parent location and if a store resides in it, travel to that store. Otherwise, the location defaults to the Riverwood Trader (location/distance doesn't always matter, see below).
-- If you are close to one of these areas, they will go in, sell things and return to you.
-- Followers have a maximum travel and return time of 1 hour (in-game). They will return to you, regardless of the distance, within an hour.
-- Followers will unlock shops to gain access to them. Convenience trumps immersion here, by design.
-- They can receive a selling bonus depending on their speech (skill 35 or above, max of 20% bonus)
-- You cannot ask a follower to sell items during combat.
-- They will ignore combat and are protected while selling.
-- You cannot send multiple followers to sell things at one time. Dialogue option and function are blocked while selling.
-- In the event that something goes awry, items are not cleared from the container until gold goes into the player's inventory.

- Favor is removed from the Command Followers power (redundant) and Sell Items has been added after Set Gear.

ToDo:
- Dialogues to direct scripts.

- Update 2.3.5

- Streamlined Properties of a couple more scripts.
- Fixed an issue where followers would not fast travel when the player does.
- Streamlined "Use Potions" feature.
- Cleaned up some visual indicators in the MCM that should be disabled if they cannot be applied or are not currently valid.
- Implemented Feature on the Follower Tweaks page, called "Use Default Combat", that ignores Combat Style and Combat Range on a follower under NFF, allowing them to completely pass through and use their native combat packages, combat style and other combat related features (if any). However, it also prevents use of the framework's Healer role. This is probably more useful for imported followers and the old imported follower conditional checks have been removed. Imported followers will default on to this option if you agree to safe settings. For previously imported followers, this will default to off.
- Animal followers can now utilize the Tank Role. Defaults to unvoiced shout.

- Update 2.3.4

NOTE:
- There have been a few internal fixes/overhauls. You do not need to start a new game or dismiss followers, etc. I would say it's a good idea to allow things to settle. After the framework updates, go into a new cell (house, tavern, whatever), wait one hour in-game. Save your game, load your game.

Fixes:
- Fixed MCM displaying 50 slots/history/etc where it should be displaying 100.
- Added slight delay to Scripts reset on a cell change.
- Removed ResetBoxCell function spam.
- Removed additional false-positives when determining if a Wench is nearby.
- Aggression change from 2.3.1 where it is only set "in combat" has been reverted. Setting followers to Unaggresive should prevent them from initiating combat. Setting it to Aggressive will allow them to attack enemies on sight. Agression is continued to be set to 0 when they are dismissed/exported to keep them from engaging "neutral" folks that are angry at the player. If a follower is not in your party upon loading a game, their aggression is not enforced (this is standard game behavior).
- Aggression is now set to 0 when the player (and followers) sneak IF Allow Stealth AI is enabled in the MCM. Aggression is restored if the player stops sneaking or a follower/player is attacked.
- Fixed an issue where animation hooks might get turned accidentally in MCM.
- Consolodated Stealth Tweaks internally to run faster.
- Global Behavior settings now set Aggression, Morality, etc, properly on new followers. Setting Behavior specifically on a follower wasn't affected by this bug.
- Attempted to fix an issue where Tavern Scene can get stuck if the follower doesn't have a supported voice.
- Added Menu Mode detection and pause while applying Adventuring Gear.
- Fixed  multiple issues where Set Gear could fail.

Improvements:
- In trying to keep the main controller script clean and lightweight, many game variables and some optional variables have been moved to a new script, nwsFollowerVariablesScript, sitting in it's own quest (the quest doesn't do anything but hold these variables in a script).  This greatly reduces the number of properties defined on the main script and the end goal is to only have conditional properties (ones you set in the MCM) present and maybe a few others. This will be a continual work in progress. This will have zero in-game effect and is just an internal change for efficiency.
- MCM Script now calls static variables from nwsFollowerVariablesScript to reduce number of defined properties.
- Note: If you read Papyrus logs, there will be a huge number of skipped variables at your next game load with the above change. This is normal and will go away as soon as you save and load a new game. Properties were removed cleanly but papyrus will still show these warnings one-time.
- All "GetFormFromFile" functions removed from Follower Alias Script. Tapping into Variables quest instead.
- Reinforced Follower checking to see if player is mounted.
- Now making threaded call to Followers when player mounting/dismounting. More efficient.
- Tweaked time and conditions on applying Adventuring Gear.
- You can now turn off "Interactive Gearing", where the follower thanks you and so on. It's Under Crafting/Interaction Defaults in the MCM. It is "all or nothing" for now (can't be set on individual followers).
- Started reducing number of option variables in the MCM script. In it's infancy stages. These are being added to small arrays over time.
- All followers now use the "packages quest" that was previously reserved for imported followers, with it's priority lowered to 50, same as the standard follower quest. Imported Followers continue to default to a higher priority quest of 70, using a different quest with the same aliases and packages.  So essentially, AI packages are delivered separately from the quest that holds their primary aliases and the follower script. This fixes an issue where packages could get double-stacked. Serana continues to use a separate package quest (priority 81) as before.
- You can now change between 3 different priorities of AI packages for followers (except Serana). As indicated above, there is a standard priority (50), high priority (70, mainly for imported followers) and a very high priority (99). This is solely for the purpose of getting some imported followers (or other followers) to use some features of the framework where those would be blocked by custom AI packages that might be designed for them.  This means if you want a follower to use: Sandboxing, Waiting, Mounting Up, Riding, Enhanced Stealth, Bump-Into, Following, Healer Role and/or Combat Styles and you are sure they are NOT using them, you can upgrade the priority so that they do.  Can it stop other mods that offer package-based features to followers? Yes, it can, so you should choose only to use it if you want NFF's features mentioned over the other mod's features for that follower. Can it break import follower quests and such? Yes, it can, unless they are scene-based, which should have zero effect on this sort of package stack. This is why I say ONLY IF YOU NEED IT.  Does it affect Convenient Horses? At the time of this writing, no, it's priority for followers is at 100, so it is higher than everything.
- MCM descriptions now describe which features are packaged-based. This means it uses an AI package.
- You can now Remove specific followers from the Framework on the Follower Slots/History Page.  Clicking on a follower slot will toggle between removal or not.  You can toggle multiple followers at once.  You should also be able to use this to clear out invalid slots IF a name is shown. Once you exit the MCM, this will process.  This is useful not only if you have invalid entries but also if you want to export multiple followers at one time.
- For those modifying this or that for their own games, the Variable Quest now holds most static variables and calls them using varScript + the property, example: varScript.ActorTypeAnimal for keyword. There is also a lot of restructuring going on internally as I find better ways to handle papyrus or to reduce the number of individual things that need to be declared.

- Update 2.3.3

Performance:
- Implemented a threading system when parts of the startup sequence are sent remotely to different scripts (attached to their appropriate quests), reducing NFF load time significantly.
- Several MCM functions are now pre-cached at game load, in the background curing NFF's startup sequence, speeding up load time for the MCM menu, intially.
- Follower Perks are now cached when selecting that follower. Initial load takes a second or two but it is cached until you use the dropdown to select a new follower.
- Converted many text parts in the MCM menu to strings in the language file.
- Changed multiple arrays to be defined on the MCM menu properties to improve efficiency and lower size of the script.

Limit Increases:
- Raised Maximum History to 100 former followers (up from 50).  Remember that this defaults to 25 on new game, so you have to raise the maximum in the MCM, if you want a larger history.
- History list in the MCM is now enumerated (001 to 100).
- Raised Stored Adventuring Sets maximum to 100 (up from 50).  That means 1 set for each individual, unique follower.
- Stored Gear Sets display in the MCM now shows 001 to 100 (versus 01 to 50).
- Raised supported number of home base followers to 100 (up from 50).

Import:
- When importing a character, recommended "failsafe" settings will be applied with one or more dialogue prompts, where can answer yes or no. Answering yes applies the lightest settings possible and then you can go up from there. There is no guarantee that this will magically make every imported follower work properly, but its headed in the right direction of making issues less common.
- The initial dialogue will deactivate several tweak settings that typically can cause issues with imported followers, especially those with delicate AI and behavior features. If you say no to this dialogue, general settings will be applied that are usually set up for normal followers.  These are (on a per-follower basis): Sandboxing Off, Enhanced Stealth Off, Default Follow Package On, Horses Off (not riding support, just the horse), Combat Role to Standard, Combat Style to Default, sets Follower to original status of Essential, Protected or None.
- If the imported follower has had their behavior set (Assistance, Confidence and Morality) then you have the choice of turning these off and reverting them to their original behavior.
- If the imported follower has been been set to do crafting or interact in taverns, you have the option here to set those to off. This is generally not very intrusive but for the safest option, you can allow this.
- Lastly, if the imported follower has had their gear set you can be prompted to undo that here. It is really going to depend on the type of follower you use if you need to active this.

- These dialogues will be shown for any imported follower that they have not already been shown for.  After you answer once for that follower, the dialogues will not be shown again.
- You can turn off these dialogues in the MCM. However, if YOU DO, it will be treated as if you answered yes to these dialogues (one time on each unique imported follower).  This is for people who want the failsafe settings applied "just in case" but don't want to see dialogues every time for each individual imported follower.

Idle Chatter:
- You can now set the frequency of Idle follower chatter. This only works on followers with vanilla dialogue, or followers that tap into the "HirelingCommentScript". RDO is also supported in the FOMOD via a script patch. Essentially, you can set this via a slider from 0 to 480 minutes (8 hours). It will also override RDO's random idle and make it the interval you have set. Setting this to 0 does NOT disable chatter, but return it to default behavior (1 hour in vanilla, random in RDO). Disabling idle chat is a different setting. Keep in mind that much of RDO's idle lines are conditional or location based.  In other words, users that are not using RDO may see more of an impact with this feature.

Movement Speed:
- You can now set variable (static) movement speed for all followers. You can set this pretty high but a good range, when static, is 125 to 175. This is an across-the-board increase and will affect all types of movement.
- You can activate dynamic speed boost for followers. This makes their speed 100 (normal) when the player is walking, stealthing or in interiors.  When the player is outdoors, running/sprinting, not in combat and followers are not near the player/not sandboxing, their speed is accelerated to the static value you set earlier (which you could set a bit higher in this case).  Speed only boosts when the player is running/sprinting for at least 3 seconds straight and returns to normal as soon as the player stops, goes indoors or enters combat. It runs inside of the sandboxing script but doesn't require sandboxing to be on. It will cause a bit of papyrus load, but not too much, so take care if you are running lots of mods, especially scripted ones.
- In either case, boosted speed will cause followers to be more likely to collide with you if they are in motion and you stop.  I would turn off Walk/Run Interpolation if you are using dynamic speed.

General Fixes:
- Fixed an issue where a game bug causes movement speed value to not update correctly.
- No longer directly edits serana's follower script for hood support. dlc1_npcmentalmodelscript removed from installation.
- Fixed an issue with empty slots showing as blank in the MCM menu, instead of "empty". Made row striping colors more distinct.
- Fixed an issue where hiring costs weren't being calculated correctly and that bonuses to hiring rank (the chance they will join you again for free) were not calculated. Also applied the gold "ching" sound.
- Behavior settings (Confidence, etc) now work correctly both in terms of global set behavior and follower stat tweaks.
- Home Bases Quest is now highest priority (100).
- Updated Load and Save Settings variables in the MCM.
- Some settings and their descriptions made more clear in the MCM menu.

Adventuring Gear:
- When setting Adventuring Gear, the follower attempts to move to the player and face him. While gear is being applied, the follower will no longer move around.


To Do:
- Check Behaviors on existing characters at load time.
- Optimize Import tweaks.

- Update 2.3.2

Adventuring Gear/Equipping:
- Fixed a visual bug in the game where armor pieces are enforced but you don't see them. This is done by giving them a ring, which triggers a re-draw of the actor's armor, then removing that ring (the ring is not available in-game).
- Implemented Feature, "Only Wear Specified Gear", that removes every armor piece except those items defined in Adventuring Gear.  It is useful for enforcing specific items and getting around outfits that are being difficult. When enabled, you cannot trade a helmet or ring (for example) and have them auto-equip it.  You have to put those things into their Adventuring Gear. This does NOT affect weapons or shields. The removal feature uses a new method by looking through the actor's inventory and removing any items that are equipped that are not in the list of Adventuring Gear. It ignores shields, unless they are part of an actor's base outfit.

Interesting NPCs:
- If a follower exists in 3DNPC's Follower Quest Alias (only the 2 follower/animal slots), it is removed upon game load. This is basically to fix an issue where the follower will follow you, even when dismissed by NFF.

Miscellaneous:
- Added Option to put NPC behind the player via dialogue (Would you mind getting behind me?). Toggled on and off via the MCM menu.
- Fixed some Language strings.
- Some debug messages removed.
- Quest markers are updated when gaining new followers, if you have tracking enabled. Will cause the quest to display as a message each time (no fix for now).
- Spells with no name are now blocked from MCM display. Also restricted display a bit more. Not all spells may show.
- Flying enemies are no longer counted for enemy detection when taunting. They must land to be counted.

- Update 2.3.1

Adventuring Gear/Equipping:
- Streamlining of some Adventuring Gear internal factions.
- If you are managing Serana's Gear OR have helmet disabled except in combat, her native Hood is disabled from functioning, nor will it be hidden in her inventory.
-- She will not have any day/night cycles from her hood.
-- You will be able to create a craftable version of her hood under the Studded Leather category for 1 Leather, 1 Leather Strip. This one can be freely traded if you want to give her a hood if you want it on in combat.
-- I'm already doing a minor edit to her script for this and I will not be providing an option that continues to allow the day/night cycle because it gets more complicated. So this is a take it or leave it scenario :) It shouldn't conflict with any Serana Visual/Ability overhauls.
-- If Serana is exported, her hood functionality returns to normal.
-- Serana's DLC1_NPCMentalModelScript.pex has been manipulated to block hood functionality.  I want to make this aware to you, in the event that some other mod affects this. It has to be altered or extended because her hood is script controlled.

Interesting NPCs:
- NOTE: I'm sorry but this has been a real mess. It was done very long ago and I didn't fully pay attention to how 3DNPC was working at the time.  On the previous update, I told you they were going to become IMPORT followers but I think that's also the wrong step.  How they are set up in 3DNPC is that they borrow "some" parts of the vanilla system but have their own tracking system (Globals, etc), so this makes it tricky to get it right and I over-actioned by going to import with them. So.... DISREGARD IMPORTING THEM. They will act like normal followers, as before, with the following notes:

- 3DNPC Followers (regular and super ones) are brought into the system as normal. The script option is re-implemented and you should install it, as before, leaving that option checked in the FOMOD.
- If you have 3DNPC Followers after this update, Flush the Slots on the Slots page in the MCM.  Then re-acquire the followers as normal.

- I have all the IDs of the super/regular followers and they are checked upon game load. Those NPCs are put into a faction, where I can quickly identify them behind the scenes.
- 3DNPC Followers are auto-removed, after a few seconds, if 3DNPC needs them for a quest (3DNPC removes them from the PlayerFollowerFaction and this is checked). Real-Time Count should be on in the MCM (on by default) for this to be smooth.
- You can no longer Import 3DNPC Followers and they are blocked from the Import dialogue. Remember, they function as before as normal followers.

- NFF now properly handles 3DNPC's own "Dismissed Follower Faction".

Follower Auto-Removal:
- NOTE: Previously there were issues with the auto-kick of invalid actors (such as dismissing an imported actor without removing her from the framework first, so NFF would automatically kick them out). This caused a variety of issues with other mods since it relies on looking at PlayerTeammate status and some other mods change this on a whim (for reasons...).  There have been changes to correct this.

- With the exception of Serana and Sofia, imported actors are no longer kicked from the framework automatically. It is up to you to remember to remove them from the framework with the dialogue option.
- Serana and Sofia are kicked when a quest of theirs causes them to leave the party.

- Though not imported, Interesting NPCs are kicked out of the party if a 3DNPC wants them removed for it's quests.

Miscellaneous:
- Concentration type spells, among others, should now be listed under the MCM ability page for a follower.  Constant-use spells are still hidden by default.
- Simplified "Stop Crafting" on cell change.
- Scenes running on Followers are no longer stopped upon changing cells (could be issues with other mods). NFF scenes should be handled already by their quests being stopped, if needed.
- Follower Aggression is only enforced during combat and set to 0 out of combat. This should further keep them from starting fights if their player teammate flag is set to false.
- Sort Slots now fixes erroneous Faction combinations, if present.

- Update 2.3.0

- Note: streamlining has been applied to the Adventure Gear system. I had the notion of moving it to an outfit system or hybrid of both, but due to issues where destructive bugs can still occur, I have pulled off of this for the forseable future.

- Note: When the game loads, NFF goes into a warm-up phase, where you'd see the startup tasks message.  During this time, which takes 2 to 3 seconds, it sets follower behaviors, checks outfits, applies 3rd party support, cleans removed/dead actors from history and gear lists and some other critical functions. Please wait until you see the startup tasks complete message before you go into the MCM menu, open interaction dialogues or save your game. This will ensure that nothing is interrupted during the warm-up.

- Yet another Note: Changes to inventory (trading, function to remove torches while sneaking, etc) will cause a follower to be updated if using Adventuring Gear or any Equipping (Hide/Show) features. This means that a helmet, shield or other worn item will be displayed for a moment then re-hidden/changed. This is by design under the system that is in place, even though it might appear as some kind of visual glitch.

Adventuring Gear/Equipping:
- Earrings are now excluded when using Remove Headwear feature.
- Added stacking protection to Adventuring Gear container script.
- If it happens that something causes applying adventuring gear to get stuck, containers are no longer cleared beforehand. That means that any leftover gear items "should" be available if you try to set gear with the same follower again.
- OnEquipped/Unequipped events on the follower alias now use "states" to eliminate papyrus stacking.
- Gear, Helmet and Shield checks/updates are more consistent and far less spammy.  Much of the code has been simplified as well.
- Adventuring Gear storage slots now raised to 50 (up from 25), supporting 50 individual followers.
- Applying Adventuring Gear to a follower who doesn't have it stored, prompts automatic storage in the first available slot, if that gear isn't already stored.
- If using Set Adventuring Gear and the items are emptied by the player, you are given the option, by message dialogue, to stop managing gear for that follower. If you select Yes, any storage slot will also be cleared. If you select No, then the follower will still have their gear managed but they are considered "naked" for Adventuring Gear purposes - no gear will be enforced but their outfit will be hidden as needed.
- The last two changes, above, will keep you from having to enter the MCM menu every time you start or stop Adventuring Gear on a follower.
- You can now view a "read-only" list of all ammo types supported by the framework (MCM, under Gear), for quiver equipping/unequipping. Remember that modded ammo needs to be traded (only once, to any follower) to include it in this list.
- Helm updating notification has been disabled for the moment.
- You can now set any specific follower to unequip their weapons outside of combat, IF the player's weapon/spells/hands are not drawn.  This is not sheathing, followers will unequip bows, swords, etc and they will not be visible on the character's model. Let me know if any issues with recharging weapons, if you use this feature.

Crafting/Tavern Drinking:
- You can now apply Crafting/Interaction features and Behaviors (Aggression, Crime, etc) globally on any recruited followers. You essentially can create your own defaults.  Followers that have previously had their crafting/behaviors set are NOT affected. Furthermore, like horses and so on, you can have followers with different settings from the defaults.
- NPCs in the trainer faction are ignored as inclusion as "wenches" when drinking in a tavern is active.
- Followers will now craft a minimum of 6 arrows or bolts. In some cases would return 0.
- Crafting/Drinking will now end if the player interacts with the follower, or they observe combat.
- Crafting AI packages now check distance from player and should stop if the player is greater than 2400 units away.

Hotkeys:
- The following can now be hotkeyed: Toggle Sandbox, Teleport Followers, Set Gear (targeted follower), Redress (targeted follower), Clone Outfit.

Importing:
- There are now several npcs in the base game that are excluded from import as they are designed to follow you for a specific quest only.  Refer to this page: https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Forum:Skyrim:Multiple_Followers
-- Any NPC under Quest Characters on that page (including Tested) cannot be imported.  They are checked against a list of blocked actors.
-- If you have imported them prior to this update, you should be able to export them. You just cannot import them afterwards.
- Reset Import Follower has been replaced with Purge Follower. This will now remove Imported, Expendable or Normal Followers from the framework.

Sandboxing:
- followers have a larger wander radius, depending on the general sandbox radius you have set up.  This should allow them to wander further from the player when there is nothing to interact with.
- When sandboxing in a dungeon, followers should no longer interact with switches and levers.  This also prevents them from sandboxing on any special furniture, but is the only way to prevent them from doing odd things.  Valid dungeons must have the "LocTypeDungeon" keyword for this to happen. If a player home has this keyword, followers will not interact with special furniture in or around it.

Waiting:
- Torch and Sneak enhancements no longer affect followers who are waiting.
- Corrected a bug where going into a different cell would cause a waiting follower to leave the party.

Miscellanous:
- Added a dummy version of the script "nwsFollower_StealthPKS" to prevent orphan script errors when using a save cleaner. This script has no effect and is not attached to any form.
- Recruiting the player's family members (spouse, children) now looks only at the player's "family" relationship with that NPC.
- Slots are no longer sorted (on update or installation) if you have no followers.
- Starting a new game with NFF or using Restart quests should be much better at clearing out aliases and setting things up overall.
- Fixed an issue in healer role where not defining a combat distance in the MCM would cause them to stand there and not do anything during combat.
- Upon enterting a new cell or game start, followers will unsheath their weapons. This fixes a game bug where the equipped weapon is not detected.
- Cached several arrays in the MCM menu.
- Added a few translations strings to the language files.
- Reduced action delay in some dialogues from 1.0 to 0.5.
- Followers now have their aggression set to 0 when dismissed or slots are sorted, to keep them from occasionally going on a murder spree if the player has offended neutral NPCs.
- Animal Followers can now have an inventory that you can interact with, like humanoid followers. This can be toggled on or off on an indvidual basis on the Follower Tweaks page. You CAN also give them gear to equip and they will wear it, however you will not see it on the model. It might not even make sense, so avoid this if you don't like immersion breaking.
- Corrected support for (non-modded) Adopted Children in regards to having children come along with you as an expendable recruit. Children are checked and added to the appropriate faction required for the dialogue upon loading an existing game. If you adopt a child during your current game and you wish to use this feature, you must save then load your game.

Features:
- Active Follower Tracking. Adds a quest to Miscellanous where you can track the locations of all existing followers.  It can be toggled on and off (off will complete the quest, if previously on). It is option and is not active by default.
- You can now directly edit Health, Magicka, Stamina and Skills of any follower. It is TEMPORARY until you level up and the follower, in turn, also levels up. This may only be useful in limited circumstances.  If you want to permanently alter follower stats, you will need to rely on the Creation Kit or xEdit.
-- Toggled via "Allow Stat Editing" on the Stats tab. While active you can edit stats on any follower in your party. When inactive, prevents any accidental editing.
-- You must assign minimum Health, Magicka and Stamina of 1.
-- You may assign minimum of 1, maximum of 100 to Skills. Editing is freeform. No points are subtracted from X and added to Y. If that makes you uncomfortable, realize that it isn't realistic to track what you've edited on an unlimited number of followers.
-- old system of adding "X" number of Health, Magicka and Stamina has been removed. You can now use your own judgement here.


- Update 2.2.9

Fixes:
- Reverted Enhanced Sneaking functions to work as in 2.2.7.  No longer attached to package, on main controller as before. Was bugging out and not working on followers randomly.
- Tweaked Horse Travel package to work more consistently. Not a complete fix but should be better.


- Update 2.2.8

Fixes:
- Adventuring Gear should no longer fail to finish the equipping process, causing items to disappear.
- Adventuring Gear dialogue now launches 1 second after asking a follower to wear items.
- Corrected an error in TrapBear.pex.
- Sneak AI package corrected to only have followers ignore combat IF the player is not in combat. Once the player enters combat, they should react accordingly.
- Taunt Effect should ignore dead opponents.
- Enhanced Sneaking ability and effects are now attached to the Sneak AI package. This means that Enhance Sneaking requires Improved Stealth AI to be active but it makes the ability less problem-free and more efficient.
- Updated Save/Load configuration to include some missed settings.
- An attempt to fix some issues where followers will dismount when the player goes into combat but they are rather far away, causing them to run a long distance on foot. This adds an additional package that ignore combat while the follower is mounted until they get within 1600 units or so from the player. It may not work perfectly well at this time.

Changes:
- At the forge, under the Jewelry section, you can now craft a "NFF Ignore Token" for followers. This can be traded to a follower. While in their inventory, they cannot be imported or exported. This simulates a blacklist feature. Tokens have no weight or value.
- Taunt now reinstated to be checked every 4 seconds while in combat (cooldown must be completed).
- Friendly fire/aquiring targets now checks every 4 seconds. It is fairly fast and non-spammy.
- BYOHHouseBuildingScript vanilla script removed. The only "base" vanilla scripts that are changed are now: DialogueFollowerScript, FollowerAliasScript, WEDogFollowerScript, QF_DialogueFollower_000750BA. Of course the other fomod options will change/replace other scripts.
- PF_nwsFollowerBrawlWatch_03167D3E script removed. Wasn't in use.
- nwsFollower_StealthPKS is a new script attached to stealth package that handles follower Enhance Sneaking.

Features:
- You can now adjust the Hiring Cost for Expendable Recruits. This is displayed in dialogues when talking to them about joining you. Mid-range rate is 60% of the value you set. Low-range is 30% of the value.
- Taunt Visual Effect can now be disabled. If you experience the visual effect knocking around objects in game, disabling it should stop this behavior.
- You can set the length of time that bleedout lasts. The game default is 15 seconds. This DOES affect all NPCs that are able to go into a bleedout state, not just followers.

- Update 2.2.7

Fixes:
- Resolved an issue where acquring a combat target results in it being perceived as a dead actor and causing papyrus errors.
- Actors that are bleeding out can no longer be acquired as a combat target.
- Combat checks are skipped if the follower is bleeding out.
- Combat checks are skipped if a check is currently processing (stacking).
- Only actors that are hostile to the player or the follower can be considered as combat targets.
- Added double-check for Dead/BleedingOut on Taunt Enemies Effect.
- debug messages removed when starting a sparring match.
- Corrected a translation file issue.

Changes:
- It is announced in-game when a follower has died.

- Update 2.2.6

Fixes:
- Imported Follower will no longer be auto-dismissed while the player is mounted (Convenient Horses compatibility).
- Fixed an issue where Teleport on demand not working if Auto-Teleport was off.
- Toggling Auto-Teleport in the MCM now refreshes the page.
- Fixed an issue where setplayerteammate gets reset to 1 prior to combat during a sparring match (it needs to be set to 0 temporarily). Possible game bug due to scene interference, so now delayed until after scene start.
- Player can now interact with followers while they are avoiding/moving out of the way.
- Moving the sandbox marker now takes height into consideration.
- Follower Follow Package: No Combat Alert flag is now on (skips alert state).
- Healing AI: can now heal imported/hired followers.
- Healing AI now correctly uses caster's Restoration skill as a healing bonus. Furthermore, healing bonus from Restoration is now 20% of skill (down from 25%), however, level is now added as a healing bonus (i.e. a 40th level caster heals a bonus of +40 points).
- Crafting, Sandboxing, Checking: Scripts now skip tasks if player is in menu mode. Reduces stacks.
- Crafting Script: Crafting Tasks are now on a single update loop. Reduces redundancy and stacks.

Changes:
- Followers at home bases will now sleep between 12am and 6am at their default home location. This may not always work at Hearthfire homes, due to bed ownership or lack of available beds.
- Follower Alias Script: All object-based Events are now filtered by type. Performance improvement to help prevent papyrus stacking.
- Follower Alias Script: All spammable Events are now using busy state bools. While in use, these bools are set to True. Once complete, these bools are set to False. This should drastically reduce papyrus stacking and invalid checks.
- Revive from Bleedout now restores 25 health (up from 10).
- Taunt Sounds changed to be more unique. Overall sound is less obnoxious.
- Taunt is no longer checked unless combat state changes. This removes all update loops during combat. This means that Taunting will not always occur periodically but is less script intensive.
- Taunt cooldown reduced to 8 seconds (down from 15).
- Healing AI reworked to be more responsive in combat and be more likely to heal other followers.
- Healing AI can now heal self and heal other followers outside of combat. Requires using NFF's follow package.
- Healing AI cooldown reduced by 1 second.
- Follower Follow Package: Tweaked distance responsiveness, followers should travel to the player if out of range, then follow.
- Follower Follow Package: Avoidance baked-in for responsiveness.
- Follower Sandbox: Followers will not sandbox if one or more followers are moderately injured (this is to allow out of combat healing).
- Follower Sandbox: Will more readily sheath weapons (not foolproof).
- Follower Sandbox: Sandbox marker now placed 128 units from player (up from 64). To help keep followers from sandboxing on top of the player.
- Animal Actors can now be added to bases, show in history and can have Health/Magicka/Stamina boosted. This was originally prevented for actors that do not have a unique actor base, to avoid confusion of seeing generic animals and guards in lists.
- Summoned minions will no longer trigger traps.
- Followers are now enhanced to more readily check for combat targets when entering combat. If the follower has no target, it will attempt to attack the player's target. If the player has no target, it will attempt to acquire a random hostile target within 1024 units.
- Friendly fire now stops its friendly opponent from attacking.
- Friendly fire now attempts to reaquire a target for the follower (plus her friendly opponent), same as checking for combat targets, above.
- Friendly fire now uses NFF's follower faction instead of checking for player teammate.
- Advanced Stealth ranges are now based on follow range.  If the follower is following close, she will stealth close. If the follower is following far, she will stealth far.
- If using the Command power on an individual follower, you can force them to get behind you by using the Follow/Wait menu and selecting "Behind Me". This teleports the follower directly behind the player. It isn't totally immersive but it doesn't need to make the follower try to get around walls of narrow corridors.
- Some coloration added to MCM menu areas to help guide the player visually.
- Gold associated follower costs now deposit that gold amount into the follower's inventory in support of mods that utilize follower gold. Try to resist the urge of stealing from your followers.

Known Issue:
- Serana cannot complete the quest that leads the player to the soul cairn if she is imported. Remove her from the framework while collecting ingredients until after the portal is opened. This is unresolvable without adding a quest condition to multiple AI packages for one point in the game. If the developers would have put her in an actual scene, this would be a non-issue.


- Update 2.2.5

- Mainly polishing and bug/game issue fixing this time around.

Fixes:
- Resolved an issue with the sandboxing package when the current cell has no location defined.
- Followers may wander a bit when sandboxing. Its low to give some variety, 256 units.
- Tweaked recharge to detect weapon types a follower has in right/left hand. Only recharges if there is a weapon presently equipped. This may also fix an odd weapon duplication bug.
- Friendly Fire now works properly again (interaction with sparring addition). Friendly Fire now also prevents followers from leaving the party, if hit in combat by the player.
- Followers will now more readily assist the player if they have no combat target.
- Slot 10 should now work properly.
- Sparring: Sparring followers are now temporarily removed from the CurrentFollowerFaction, if they are in it, and placed back in it when the match is over. This may help player versus follower fights, it may not.
- Some option conflicts resolved in the MCM.
- Auri (Song of the Green) should now be able to summon her mount. Be sure to turn off horses in Auri's Tweaks page in the MCM.
-- Note: In xEdit, Auri's esp modifies "FollowerPackageTemplate", which will change it for ALL followers in the base game. I recommend you remove this entry as base packages should not be changed unless that is the point of the mod.
-- There is an outstanding issue where Auri will attempt to ride her mount if it is nearby when sorting slots.  Her riding quest is of pretty high priority (80), which causes her to mount often. You'll have to deal with this behavior for now, if I raise quest priority to overtake it, then other mods will break.  She is a cool follower though and I have enjoyed fiddling with her.
- Animals are automatically set to the "no horse" faction, so shouldn't try to summon a mount. This will be set automatically upon game load.
- Tightened up Check Count script to be sure that it only removes invalid followers that are imported.
- Check count script will now attempt to restore "isPlayerTeammate" flag if a situation occurred where a sparring match was interrupted and followers could lose this flag.
- Teleport should now check z-distance (up and down).
- slot int variables depreciated and removed. Now using GetID() directly.

Changes:
- MCM was getting overloaded with options on Interaction and System tabs. Interaction now split into Activity (Sandboxing, Movement, Stealth - new section) and Gameplay (all remaining options). Quest and Dialogue based options from System are now shown on a Quest tab.
- Dialogue Followers aliases now directly use the packages that are in the Framework's Package Quest, instead of having aliases in two different quests. Upon game load, followers are removed from Package Quest aliases, if they are not needed.
- Follower Package Quest is now only used for imported followers.
- If a follower is riding on a mount, the stealth, bump, heal, sandbox and follow packages will be ignored. This will not have any affect on how packages work and simply exists as a "pass though" condition, if needed.

Features:
- Followers may now enter an advanced stealth mode while the player is sneaking. This essentially makes them nearly undetectable (sound still causes detection). Followers are set to be semi-transparent while in this mode, but you can change the alpha in the MCM (1.0 being solid).
- You can now set the chance of receiving a gift from a follower, if using the Regard system.  Default is 33% and this is checked daily (more or less - there's an 8-hour difference, randomized).
- You can now reset a follower's Regard to its default. The default is 0 for most followers, 4 for Spouses, Housecarls, Children.

Notes:
- PDF guide is very outdated.

- Update 2.2.4

Fixes/Changes:

- Follower AI Quest Priority lowered back to 55. I wasn't thinking clearly on conflicts with other quests by trying to solve other conflicts.
- Sandboxing now toggles properly using Command Followers.  If it previously was off, it will default to Allow.  If it was previously set to Allow & Autobox, then that setting will be stored and toggled to when going from off to on.
- Resolved an issue where toggling sandbox wasn't moving the sandbox marker.
- Stopping sandboxing now evaluates AI packages.
- You can now set sandboxing options in the MCM, even if sandboxing is set to off (so that you can fine-tune it when toggling with Command Followers).
- Sandboxing activation/deactivation is now delayed until you exit the MCM menu.
- Heal AI (Non-combat) now has a timeout of 3.0 seconds. This is to help prevent AI stuck bugs (happens sometimes with custom packages).
- Share the Wealth feature no longer works in city locations. This is mainly to fix an issue where the player would share gold with followers after serving time in jail.
- Want to bring your child or spouse on adventures with you? Now you can. "Allow Expendable Recruits" must be toggled on in MCM menu. You will still receive some dialogue options related to child/spouse behavior, which may be best untouched. Never requires a hiring cost. Will not affect spouses or children that can already join you as a follower.
-- Recruit/Dismiss dialogue is different for spouse/child. Recrut: "Want to come on an adventure with me?". Dismiss: "I think it's time you for you to go home.".
-- Hire cost, if used, is not applied to your children.
-- If using Regard, your children start at Rank 4.
- Sandboxing/Warp Checks are only started on game load if the player has followers.
- Fixed some Start/Stop Sandbox issues related to Warping/Sandboxing in the MCM and in the Count Checking script.
- Sandbox Checks will no longer run if no followers are in the party.
- Command Followers power will not work if no followers are in the party.

Known Issues:

- Please note that if it appears that some followers are sandboxing and some are not (and there are not other circumstances, like specific follower settings, etc) it is likely that some followers simply cannot find objects to interact with. The game randomly determines what sandboxing actors will do so it doesn't always matter if there are 3 chairs, a forge and a workbench within reach.
- Followers that are with you will not sandbox in a cell that doesn't have a location, if you have Sandbox in Town Only or other specific options applied. This applies more to Home Base locations. When they are dismissed, they will sandbox normally.


- Update 2.2.3

- Due to some "vanilla style" followers mods enforcing combat styles via quests with combat overrides, priority of NFF AI package quest raised to 100.
- Teleport on demand minimum range reduced from 512 to 256. This fixes an issue where a follower could get stuck in a doorway and you are too close to teleport them out.
- Fixed Follower Follow dialogue action issue.
- Fixed an issue where Sort Slots was setting IsPaying flag to false on follower aliases.

-- Sparring:
- NFF Sparring Quest raised to priority 100.
- Followers will no longer cheat in sparring matches involving no weapons.
- When sparring, participating followers relationship rank (to the player) is reduced to 0 (Aquaintence). It is restored when the match is over. This should resolve some issues with some followers that refuse to fight other followers.
- Sofia will now spar with other followers. She will not spar with the Player as her wardrobe quest stops combat if it involves the player. Why? You tell me. Stopping this quest could cause issues with Sofia, so that's just the way it goes.


- Update 2.22

- Hotkeys no longer function while in the crafting menu.
- Some combat error issues resolved (papyrus).
- Fixed some issues caused by followers that do not have base outfits when using Adventuring Gear.
- If somehow an empty actor is passed to "Remove Follower", it is ignored. This should eliminate messages where a follower is said to be removed but no name shows. Same added to functions for Follower Death, Exporting Imported Followers and Dismissing Guards.
- Regard Courage spell and spell effect removed. Instead, the actor's confidence value is boosted, if needed.
- IsPlayerTeammate bool and Confidence rating are now stored on the follower alias, so those can be changed and reverted when needed.
- If you have removed a follower that had Adventuring Gear stored, any related forms are cleared.
- Combat Styles now work properly.

- Optimization of the MCM menu is in progress.  The following are complete:
-- Follower perk display is now cached. Other sections will follow.
-- Reduction of the number of on/off switches (toggles) everywhere by turning options into a menu where it is logical to do so.
-- Combat Styles show unique descriptions when switched to.

- Share the Wealth, in MCM, is now a menu. Choices are off, on and "on, silent". Silent will not show a message box and automatically distribute wealth randomly, when conditions are met.
- Allow Regard, in MCM, is now a menu. Choices are off, on and "on, silent". Silent will not show regard rank increase or bonus messages.

- Core System Optimizations to allow the main controller script to run more smoothly with less delay and function stacking.
-- Some single-fire actions are now cached. They are sent via a single update (1 second) and then performed. You should notice less delay in dialogue-based actions.  This affects dialogue concerning Sparring, Recruit, Dismiss, Import, Export.
-- Sandboxing, Teleport and Crafting now run in their own instances using their own quest/script. You should see performance benefits when a lot is going on in game.

- Crafting overhaul/optimization
-- Crafting runs in it's own quest/space as indicated above.
-- Crafting no longer uses faction rank switching to handle followers who are crafting or interacting. It now stores that actor temporarily in an alias in main crafting quest. This greatly will reduce issues where a follower might get skipped over during crafting sequences.
-- Crafting/Interaction now randomizes the follower list (for crafting order) by adapting the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm.
-- Crafting is now able to handle different tasks simulataneously (one follower making a torch while another sharpens their weapons).
-- Crafting re-scans the area periodically even if the player isn't moving or auto box is being used.
-- Crafting makes better attempt to find objects near the follower.
-- If going into crafting mode, a follower will now walk if close to the crafting station and run to it only if they are far away.
-- Tavern Drinking - Followers now do a "give idle" after receiving a drink from a server.
-- Tavern Scene redesigned to perform better and with less issues/hangs.
-- Tavern - Followers will no longer order drinks in temples, lol.
-- Tavern - wenches/servers are now looked for in multi-level buildings.
-- Drunk effect is no longer a magic effect and is handled on the follower's alias.  It should no longer fail to exit a drunk idle.

- Follower teleport will now summon a follower who is in a running scene.

- Skyhaven Temple recruitment should now work properly (reworked system).
-- QF_FreeformSkyHavenTempleA_000E38C9 no longer needed and not included in FOMOD Blades Options.  If manually installing, remove this file (otherwise you can receive duplicate blades outfits).
-- As above, BladesChangeOutfitScript no longer needed in Core installation.

- Sort Slots now handles animal followers properly.
- Animals should be able to properly use the Regard system. They can also give gifts (i.e. they dug it up... why not).
- Restructured 3rd Party mod detection.
- Corrected an issue where the 4th slot might not have been correctly storing armor pieces when using Set Follower Gear.  A slightly different method of handling armor is now in place.

FEATURES:
- Followers can now Craft Potions. Similar to other crafting. Followers will only craft health potions of the appropriate level and only if within an Alchemy station. Cooldown is 8 hours in-game.
- Followers can now Craft steel Bolts instead of Arrows (you cannot craft both on the same follower).
- If using Hearthfires, you can now dismiss a Steward. This is done by grabbing the necessary faction using GetFormFromFile and storing it.  It does not change or alter any Hearthfires quests or dialogue.
- You can now cause your horse to appear behind you, out of camera, instead of in front of you, when using Call Horse hotkey.
- Increased Player hits on allies/friends in some circumstances.
-- A single hit outside of combat on a Follower no longer dismisses them, they must be hostile to the player first.
-- Hits on Friends in Combat raised from 4 to 15 (Game setting: iFriendHitCombatAllowed) - this was done long ago, just being notated here.
-- Hits on Friends in Non-Combat raised from 0 to 5 (Game setting: iFriendHitNonCombatAllowed).
-- Hits on Allies in Non-Combat raised from 3 to 5 (Game setting: iAllyHitNonCombatAllowed).
- You can now adjust the avoidance distance (from the player) while followers are sandboxing. The default is 120 units. Lower this if followers are avoiding you too often when you approach them.
- Along with Sort Slots, there is an option to "Flush Slots" in the slots page. This will dismiss/export all followers and then force all framework slots to be cleared.  Using "Dismiss All" with the command ability will also perform a flush.

- Added Sparring System (beta)
-- This is a beta, beta feature. It generally works well but can be head-scratching when it fails.  Feel free to report issues concerning it but do not act surprised if something is odd.  I really like it for testing the strength of followers against each other or testing NFF's combat styles or even seeing how well you fare against your followers.
-- Dialogue is activated under System in the MCM.
-- You can spar with your follower, either unarmed or free-for-all (weapons, spells, etc).
-- Some imported followers will not spar.  Serana will. Mrissi and Sofia will not (for example).  They are using some means to halt friendly fire that I'm not able to yet figure out.
-- You can cause two followers to spar each other.
-- Does not use the vanilla brawl system or touches it. Uses some concepts/code by Enai Siaion from Modern Brawl Fix (permission granted on mod page).
-- This is great for gauging follower strength against you or against another follower.
- When you and a follower are sparring:
-- If you win a match, it does add to Brawls won.
-- If you sheath your weapon, you forfeit and the fight is stopped.
-- If you are doing an unarmed fight and you cheat (spell, weapon, etc), you forfeit and the match is stopped.
-- Give yourself room to spar. If you accidentally hit a bystander, the match is stopped.
- You can stop a fight by drawing your weapon and then sheathing it. If your weapon is already drawn at the start, simply sheath it.
- Sparring will grab up to 3 bystanders and 3 of your followers to potentially make comments and watch the fight.
- Potential issues (Under investigation. These may very well be game-related bugs)
-- With any issues with the brawl, like imported followers refusing to fight or a weapon glitch, if you draw and sheath your own weapon, a forfeit will occur.
-- There may be a bug where bleedout on the player will cause heartbeat sound or screen visuals when hurt to keep playing. Fast traveling may fix this. Injuring yourself seems to fix this (I've tried to heal then injure the player in the script to help fix it).
-- I am still smoothing out certain conditions, such as the player hitting a bystander or a guard and then everyone goes batshit.  Try to keep distance from bystanders.
- Sparring should stop all crafting and tavern interaction.

- ToDo: Removed Follower Fix, Adventure Gear Final.

- Update 2.21

- Serana and Sofia should no longer get randomly removed from the framework.
- Toggles for Spell Learning (Book or Casted) should now switch properly.
- Hire Steward Hearthfires function should be fixed.
- String issues should be fixed in the MCM.
- MCM Abilities tab now shows spells with a cast time of under 1.0.  Note: Temporary spells from other mods may also show up in this section.
- Dependencies removed from Skyhaven Temple Quests.
- FOMOD Installer now installs sound files.
- FOMOD Installer now has the option to install Vanilla Skyhaven Temple support. If you are using "Skyhaven Temple Restored and Expanded" make sure this option is DISABLED.  If you are not using this mod, ENABLE this option.  You will NOT get the option to make Blades outfits optional if the aforementioned mod is installed. This mod has not been fully tested by me.
- Skill Affinity now detects if a follower is wearing a piece of light or heavy armor when potentially awarding a skill point to the player.
- Command, Dismiss All, now informs you that followers are being dismissed.
- Follower Bases: Moving a Home, Work or Relax location now clears it's old name.
- Follower Bases: Relax Location now works properly.
- Share the Wealth is ignored when no followers are with you.
- Confirm Import/Export feature added. If enabled, a message box will prompt you when importing or exporting a follower. The intent is to block accidentally hitting Import/Export.

- Set Adventure Gear tweaked.
-- Gear items are no longer missed and should be consistently stored and applied.
-- When you set adventuring gear, an attempt is made to only remove their outfit, instead of removing everything. "Undress when Equipping" in the MCM menu will continue to clear out most of the followers equipment slots, if the tweak causes an issue with some followers.  It is more efficient to try without it, first.
-- "Undress when Equipping" can now be toggled even if a Gear set has not yet been created.
-- Gear may stick more consistently when changing cells, as UnequipItem has been changed to UnequipItemEx (SKSE).  This affects unequipping a follower's base outfit.

- Follower Horses feature tweaked and redesigned in some areas.
-- Followers are no longer given ranks in the nwsFF_HorseFaction faction. Instead, their horse is matched according to their slot position (Alias ID's are identical).
-- nwsFF_HorseFaction is depreciated and no longer used.
-- nwsFF_NoHorseFac is a new faction that stores whether or not you've allowed a follower to use a horse. Since this is new, you will have to tweak followers again if you don't want specific ones to use a horse provided by NFF.
-- Followers will no longer randomly not have a horse to ride.
-- If Follower Horses are set to stay around and the player fast travels (or is otherwise at far distance from the horses) and mounts, follower horses are teleported to you.
-- A follower's horse will disappear when they are dismissed, even if they are set to stay around (there is a finite number of horses).
-- Follower dismounting and disabling is now handled on the follower alias script, speeding up the process.
-- Horses no longer fade in and out when Enabled/Disabled. This is more abrupt but processes faster.
-- Horse Effects, if used, are re-applied more consistently.
-- Horse Effect appearances tweaked/redesigned.
-- In MCM, changing mount style will force update of horses when the menu is closed.
-- In MCM, disabling follower from using a horse, will remove that horse if keep horses is set.

KNOWN ISSUE:
- Using Extinguishing Torches on a follower with a hidden helm will cause the helm to appear for a moment, when they exit a crouching state.

- Update 2.20

FIXES/TWEAKS:
- Follower Packages Quest Priority lowered to 55 (from 90). This should restore compatibility with most mods that rely on package stacks.
- Serana now uses her own Packages Quest when imported (Priority 81). Required as she uses packages across multiple quests for her functionality.
- Package Quest Force/Clear re-written.
- Hired (Expendable) Followers will now use Packages Quest (bug).
- Toggling "Teach Spells" or "Learn Spells from Books" now refreshes the tab.
- Followers can be set to use their own default "follow" package, mainly for imported followers. If used on a regular follower, they will use the vanilla follower player package.  Enabling this feature (under Follower Tweaks) will not allow you to set a following range, as it skips this package.
- Under the System tab, added a Debugging section. You can attempt to reset an imported follower here.  Affects a target under the crosshair.  Can be used even if the NPC is not in the party. Try not to use this on non-imported followers.
- The option to hide Import/Export dialogue has been reverted and removed for now. May be changed to a Yes/No dialogue warning box in the future, with the option to show that box or not.

- Update 2.19

MCM Tweaks:
- Completely reworked MCM menu on the back end due to "State" limitations. Now using version 1 of the MCM API.
- "Stop Gear Managment" is now a "button" instead of a checkbox.
- Added "Click Here" text for items that function as buttons, where logical to do so.

FIXES:
- Hearthfires fix to hiring Steward (BYOHHouseBuildingScript).
- Animal followers no longer summon horses.
- Horses no longer disappear if you've set them to stay around.
- Expendable Recruits now properly clear factions and other values upon death.
- Animal followers mods that attempt to automatically add animals as party members will no longer evoke the message that they are already a follower. This is most likely due to a script attached to the actor that always runs "onActivate" (which means any time you interact with the animal).
- Sort Follower Slots now properly clears or moves variables from one slot to another (it did some but not all, before).
- Follower package stack is evaluated when entering a new cell.
- Sneak distance from the player is now increased.
- Horse riding distance from the player is now increased.
- "Explosion" radius for Taunt set to 0.0. Should no longer knock over havok objects.

TWEAKS:
- You are now notified when the framework is fully loaded, including background tasks. This happens upon initial installation or loading a save file. Can be turned off.
- New updates will automatically sort followers (so that I don't have to tell you when to do it on an update). Please allow this to complete, takes a second or two. **
- Import/Export can now be hidden from dialogues.
- All followers now use the Package Quest aliases for handling AI. Previously it was only used by imported followers. This splits the larger follower AI package into smaller packages and runs them at a higher priority.
- Main scripts restructured and optimized.
- Imported followers can now be given Combat Roles (Tank, Healer). This will override the combat package that comes with them.  For example, if you make Sofia a spellsword using her MCM function and you also make her a Healer using NFF, she will not be a spellsword (as defined by Sofia's mod). If you want them to use their original combat package, leave set to Standard.
- Saving Settings reminds you to also save your game, required to generate the actual save file.
- "OnUpdateGameTime" function on the follower aliases is now designed to perform a single update in one-hour intervals.  This only occurs if a follower is waiting (vanilla style), is hired (paid a daily rate) or has the sharpened weapons buff.  It's also in place for future features.
- Crafting cooldowns system reworked (yes, again). It has been changed to tracking directly on the alias instead of fire-and-forget spells. Reason is that spell effects are removed when entering a new cell and I was under the incorrect assumption that they lasted their duration (silly me for thinking duration actually means duration).  If you dismiss and then recruit a follower who might have recently crafted, their startup crafting times will be delayed by a random amount of time.
- Crafting order (of followers) is randomized.
- Followers now only craft torches if they have less than 3 (instead of 3 or less). Goes hand in hand with "Follower Torches Expire" in new features.
- Interaction in the Tavern had the same duration issues and has been fixed.  However, becoming "drunk" is handled more realistically. A follower can safely drink 1 drink per hour and not be drunk. If they drink more than that, then there is a chance, influenced by the number of drinks over the hourly limit (similar to real life... immersion!). Followers will neutralize one drink per hour (all in game time, so 3 minutes real time).
- Followers that are in a waiting state will no longer craft or interact in taverns.
- Waiting followers can not longer be summoned via Command Followers (bug).  You can still summon them via History, if you wish.
- Expel Follower option now removes guards and exports imported followers.
- Dismiss and Dismiss All menu functions now export imported followers. Same with divorce (as unlikely as that might be).
- Tavern Interactions - Support for non-conventional inn locations (Drunken Huntsman), support for Immersive Wenches. Eligible NPCs that can be interacted with must still have suitable vanilla voice and be in the innkeeper, innserver or job faction. There could be false positives.
- Wording of "sandbox" when toggling sandbox changed to "relax".

- There is now a function in place for detecting (problematic) advanced followers. Sofia and Serana are directly supported at this time.  This does not mean that other advanced followers cannot be used, just that this is "official" support because I've spent time using them and can work out any quirks.
- Sofia's esp is detected if installed. Her actor reference is added to a special alias that is used to get her to work correctly when importing. When you interact (talk) with her, her party status is detected, allowing proper import/export.  If import or export does not show up and she's been recruited by you, wait a moment and talk to her again. Most of the time there shouldn't be a delay, but it can happen.
- Fixed an issue where imported followers could be dimissed when using the command ability to make all followers wait, if you used their "follow me" dialogue afterwards.

- Serana and Frea have voiced dialogue when in tavern interactions, Share the Wealth and Regard gift-giving.  Frea is detected without a dependency. Sofia does not have voiced dialogue in these instances as I need permission from the author to utilize the voices files and it has not been granted.

FEATURES:
- When applying Adventuring Gear, you can force a follower to remove all of their old gear first. This may be useful if a follower is using an outfit with "leveled items" used to generate it as those items may not be properly detected. Keep in mind that it will remove everything they are wearing and ONLY equip items dictated specifically in their list of Adventuring Gear.  This is found on the Gear tab as "Undress when Equipping". Set on a per-follower basis.

- Followers can be set to extinquish their torches when the player is stealthing. Behind the scenes, this removes all torches from their inventories when stealthed and restores them when the player comes out of stealth. This is a global, all or nothing, setting found under Actions in the Interaction tab.

- "Follower Torches Expire" - I made an assumption when allowing followers to craft torches. I thought that, like the player, those torches expire when being used. They do not... Which doesn't make a lot of sense of followers crafting them. So, followers torches can now be set to expire.  Follower torches last one hour of game time (3 minutes). This is a minute less than regular torches but it lines up well with the cooldown system.  Also, if a follower unequips then equips a torch before the 3 minutes, the torch will be reset (just like how torches work on Players, if you didn't know this). Followers tend to change their held items quite often, so this shouldn't be an issue.

- "Weekly Follower Cost" - You can set a Weekly Follower Cost for any followers you recruit. This is the value, per week, in gold that you need to pay each follower in order to retain them.  Setting or changing this value ONLY affects new recruits so if you want to apply a cost to existing followers (or change their current rate), you need to dismiss them then re-recruit them.  If applied to "hirelings" as defined in NFF, you will no longer be able to re-recruit them for free.  Retainer cost is never applied to housecarls or your spouse as I don't feel it really make sense. You can check the current rate for any individual follower by checking their Stats tab, near the bottom.

When applied to a non-imported follower, and you don't have the gold to pay them, every hour (game time) there is a chance they will leave you.  For imported followers, they cannot be set to force-leave you, as it behind the grasp of this mod to do that. However, they can leave the framework (deciding to no longer follow your rules, so to speak).  In either case, the player must have the gold ON THEM, not stored in a container somewhere.  If you wind up with the gold, you can enter into a dialogue with them in order to pay them.

If you dismiss them early (less than a week) you will have to pay them a partial amount.

- "Share the Wealth" feature allows you share big hauls of gold with your followers. This is another "gold sink" but does give them a morale boost for a short time, granting some bonus health.  This occurs randomly, distributing half the gold from looted containers or dead bodies to your followers. You can change the minimum amount to share in the MCM menu.

- Regard system implemented ("Allow Regard"). This is sort of a relationship system in that it determines the bond that develops between you and your followers as you adventure and fight alongside of them. It is somewhat simple at this time but may be expanded in the future. It is more of a roleplay feature but has some benefits at certain ranks.

Regard has no affect or influence from your game relationship to them. For one, the relationship system for followers is often inflated, making them instantly allies or lovers. For two, even if you are friends with someone and you see them in town from time to time, it can be a different story entirely to spend time with them "on the road".  There's also no influence if followers have been with you for a while prior to implementing this feature, everyone starts at ground zero (couple of exceptions, below).

You can disable regard for a follower if you wish (or not use the feature at all, it's optional).

Regard starts higher for spouses (rank 4) and for housecarls (rank 3).

There are 10 Regard ranks, from 0 to 9 (Indifferent to Reverent). You can check a follower's Regard at any time on the Stats tab. At this time, Regard cannot decrease, nor can be custom-tailored to a follower's morality.

When a follower is with you, their Regard rank is converted to a larger pool of points (rank x 100) to allow events and happenings in game to increase their points and thus, their Regard rank. When a follower is dismissed, their points are converted to a new Regard rank.  When going from points to rank, fractional values are lost, so when dismissing a follower, it's best to do it after they have recently gone up in rank (you are notified of this). For example, a follower with a Regard rank of 4 needs 500 points to get to rank 5. If you are at 478 points and dismiss them, they are still at rank 4. Regardless of this limitation, points are fairly easy to obtain.

The following events grant Regard points at this time: Generally spending time with you (minor increase, calculated every 6 hours), fighting alongside you (per combat "event", minor increase), paying them a salary (moderate increase on a weekly basis), sharing wealth with them via Share the Wealth feature (moderate increase). All points have randomness to them.  When a follower goes up in a rank, you are notified with a simple message.

At Rank of Trustworthy (3), a follower will occasionally give you gifts. These will be crafting materials and can be ingots, leather or gems. It is assumed that they shopped for you while out of sight or have collected things from time to time.
At Rank of Faithful (6), the follower will no longer be affected by spells and abilities that would cause them to flee.
At Rank of Reverent (9), your follower will hold you in the highest regard and be given an Inspired buff. This boosts their Health and Stamina by 25 and makes them more effective when using Destruction, Archery, One-Handed and Two-Handed (+10 skill).

You can turn off any of these granted abilities (for all followers) in the MCM.

- "Call Player Horse" - You can set a hotkey that will call the last ridden horse to you. When pressed, you will whistle and if at a great distance, the horse will be teleported to you. Once the horse is in your vicinity, it will walk to you.

- Update 2.18

FIXES/TWEAKS:
- Missing Stray Dog script added.
- Missing Have Drink script added.
- MCM should support all non-english versions of Skyrim (though it will appear in English). Covers Czech, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Russian and Spanish.
- You can now choose the Sandbox radius (1024, 2048, 4096) in the MCM. Larger radius will allow followers to move around and interact more freely, smaller radius will keep them closer nearby.
- Sandbox marker now updates its position as the player moves. This is done in blocks of 512 units (the marker will move to the player every 512 units he moves). This has a subtle effect of followers gradually moving to where the player is located as he moves around (if they are still sandboxing).
- If able to craft arrows, the formula for the number created has been updated.  Followers with higher Archery should make more.
- Last picked follower now remembered when closing the MCM menu.
- Crafting/Interaction cooldown design has changed.  Instead of tracking it according to the followers you currently have, a magic effect is applied to that follower as a cooldown. This eliminates the issue of followers resetting their crafting/interaction when dismissed and re-recruited.  This should work indentical as before for crafting, just the mechanism for tracking time has changed.  For interaction with wenches, the cooldown is a fixed 15 minutes of game time (90 seconds real time) with a 25% chance they will fetch a drink if their cooldown is over.  This should be more efficient will less design issues for future crafting/interaction implementation.
- Affinity check values now move correctly when sorting followers.
- Reduced weapon charge time slightly, if you have enabled followers to recharge magic weapons. Was a little too spammy after last optimization.
- Attempt made to streamline the summoned horses feature and possibly have less chance of ctd/freeze for those that are experiencing it (I have not been able to reproduce the ctd here).  Horse-based packages no longer fire off any scripts and it's all done on the animation events. Animation events moved to the main controller script (off of the player alias), they are fire and forget events.  Tightened up horse summoning code and disable code. Fixed "ghost" effect so it looks ghostly. Horse actors are "cached" if possible to speed up the summoning function.
- "Sandbox_Radius" and "Sandbox_Range" are now saved/loaded in configuration.

- Note on Sandboxing: If you want it closer to the "old way", as in pre-2.1.8, in the MCM set "Relax Radius" to 1024, "Relax Ramp-up" to 0.  Remember that you can check "Only Sandbox in Town", if you don't want followers to sandbox in dungeons, out on the open road, etc.

- Update 2.17

UPDATE PROCEDURE:
- Recommended: Go to a new cell. Sort follower slots. Wait one hour, in-game. Save and reload your game.

FIXES/TWEAKS:

- Agression for actor can only be set to Aggressive or Unaggressive to prevent issues with neutral NPCs.
- Stray dogs no longer are able to automatically join the party. Instead, when you talk to a stray dog, you will get optional dialogue to recruit them. This fix essentially neuters the WEDogFollowerScript.
- Hiring dialogue now checks to make sure the player has enough gold.
- Framework no longer affects fBumpReactionSmallDelayTime for compatibility with other mods that affect this value (was set to 0.5, now is at default of 1.0 if unmodded).
- Noticeably increased gather distance if player is stealthing and Stealth AI is enabled (from 128 to 160 minimum).
- Greatly increased sandboxing radius (from 1024 to 2048). Removed ability to wander outside sandbox radius (package tweak).
- Followers no longer run to you when they are out of sandbox range (package tweak).
- Followers now sandbox around the player instead of themselves, so will gradually move to your location when sandboxing.
- Rebuilt sandbox routine to be more efficient and include crafting checks.  If using basic sandboxing, then there is a ramp-up time when the player is sprinting/running before followers stop sandboxing (3 seconds by default, can be set in MCM).
- Sandboxing is stopped/reset when entering a new location. Crafting/Interaction quests are stopped as well.
- Improved combat awareness. Followers now react more logically to new enemies/enemy detection (package tweak).
- Rewritten PDF guide with specific impact and changes noted for each feature.


FEATURES:

- Teach Followers Spells - You can now elect to teach followers spells you have equipped instead of trading books to them. It appears on the menu when using the command power on a follower. Must be enabled in the MCM.

- Home Base Creation and Management - Really too much to go into in depth here, it's all in the PDF guide. Basically, you can set up 10 home bases and for each base define a home location and optionally a work and relax location. You can name your bases and rename the locations displayed. You can travel at will to your bases. You can easily shift followers from one base to another. Do not use simultaneously with MHIYH (on the same follower), choose one or the other for that follower.  Has it's own section in the MCM.

- Skill Affinity - Similar in concept to AFT's "Synergy" but designed differently.  This allows you to learn some combat-related skills from your followers when you fight alongside them with the idea that they are taking from the ability to allow you to skill up by dispatching enemies and getting hits in before you do.  There's more depth in the PDF guide on this, but every so many "fights", a follower's skills are checked against the player's to see if you learned anything from them, granting you an small skill increase. What an npc has done in combat, skill weights (how high they skills are) and random chance comes into play here. As far as combat actions go, it's just a very quick and basic glimpse of what the follower has equipped and assumed to have been using, not monitoring all their attacks and actions, so it isn't flawless.  If a follower has a much higher skill than yours, it's more likely that you learn something from them. However, there's always a base chance that you'll learn something as even a master can learn from a student. Affinity should be quicker when you are at low levels and have lower skill and slower when you are at higher level with better skill.

- Object Awareness - Upon sandboxing, the framework will detect if suitable furniture items are nearby (Forge, Anvil, etc) and if so, followers can be set up to interact with them for interaction or immersion purposes (starting other quests/scenes). This will be expanded in the future.  Requires sandboxing to be enabled in NFF.
- Crafting - Hand in hand with Object Awareness, when in sandbox mode, followers can craft various items if within range of certain furniture items.  Currently, they can craft Torches, Arrows and Sharpen their weapons.  Object creation has 8 hour cooldown, sharpen has 6 hour cooldown. This is a convenience function and they do not expend materials, it is assumed they have acquired them along the way.  Crafting is stopped when the player changes locations. Followers will not craft in dungeon locations.
- Interaction - Can interact in taverns and order drinks. This is a flavor thing and has no significant buff or gameplay changes. They can get drunk if they have already been drinking. Occurs randomly in taverns, up to an hour between drinks.  Supports male child, argonian male, female nord, female shrill and female sultry voiced innkeepers and servers. Supports Immersive Wenches and mods that add npcs if they use those voices. Notifications and drunk option can be turned off in MCM. Interaction is stopped when the player changes locations.

- You can now turn off the Protected flag for followers. If this flag is off, followers can be killed by you and will not enter bleedout, they will die. However, most followers in the game and downloaded are Essential, so this will make no difference at all. Only expendable followers (soldiers, guards, etc) will be affected and mods that specifically provide non-essential followers. You can also modify followers on your own to be non-essential using the CK or xEdit but that is squarely on you, along with any ramifications for doing so.

- Move Proximity - you can now control the distance at which followers are too close to you and move out of your way (flee). The default value is 12 units but can be changed in the MCM under System, Movement. This is to help with some issues with some mods and for VR users (though I'm not explicitly recommending VR because I cannot test it).

- Damage Multiplier - You can now change the base damage a follower inflicts (lower or higher). Under follower tweaks in the MCM. Permanent change to that actor, even if they are not with you.

- Just want to note here that Sandboxing will feel a little different. As mentioned in fixes, there is a ramp-up time concerning movement, it isn't automatically detected, thus making entering/leaving sandboxing less jerky.  It is 3 seconds by default which means that once followers are sandboxing, you must be sprinting/running for 3 seconds for that to be a valid condition for stopping the sandboxing.  Drawing your weapon, crouching, etc will continue to stop sandboxing as normal (unless you have auto-boxing on, of course).  You can adjust the Ramp Up time in the MCM.



- Update 2.16

FIXES:
- Fixed an issue in MCM where you couldn't change Sandbox Relaxing Time.
- Fixed an issue in MCM where Global Horse Skin shows an erroneous value.
- If a follower is designed to be essential, essential will be displayed as checked in the MCM.
- Conditional variables are now reset when dismissing (or exporting) a follower or sorting slots. More of an optimization than a fix.
- Stray Dog script now sends directly to the NFF's controller script.
- The framework now tries to detect if it has a position in your load order that is causing a problem with slots (aliases). If less than 10 slots are detected as being available, the mod will warn you and ask you to exit the game and correct the issue.

TWEAKS:
- If Weapon Recharged Notification is enabled, the name of the weapon is displayed when a follower recharges it.
- If Weapon Recharged Notification is enabled, the name of the gem is displayed if a follower uses one.
- When in the Healing Role (set in MCM) and a follower heals a party member (or the player), bonus healing is granted based on their Restoration skill. It's around 25% of their skill as bonus healing, so a follower with 60 restoration would heal an additional 15 points (90 total).
- Calm Followers power now has a dual function. If used during fighting, it will work as normal: followers are calmed. However, it can now be used outside of combat to fix any follower that is having an animation glitch (running in place, constantly blocking, turning in different directions, etc). Outside of combat it will cause a brief stagger that is not harmful, which should fix these glitches.
- Command Followers will more accurately detect a follower who is under the crosshair (otherwise it attempts to detect by hitting the follower with an invisible, harmless projectile).
- When checking an outfit (upon game load, entering a new cell, etc), instead of re-loading all armor pieces, the function now checks only against that actor's base outfit and unequips any of those outfit items that are visible. This is far more efficient with less stutter from reloading 3D and without seeing multiple pieces appear and disappear.
- Stored Adventure Gear slots are now increased from 15 to 25.

FEATURES:
- Command Followers and Calm Followers can now can be keymapped in the MCM. The player does not need to have the actual abilities to use them if they are hotkeyed.
- Command Followers ability can now be removed from the player (for use with hotkey only, above).
- Calm Followers visual has been changed. Old visual + imagespace does not work properly when keymapped.
- Followers can now be set to automatically unequip their quiver (removing arrows/bolts from their back) if they are not using a ranged weapon. It supports all vanilla arrows but can learn to affect arrows/bolts from mods or DLC if you trade those items with a follower who has this feature enabled (you will have to re-trade with them one-time if they already have mod/DLC ammo prior to this feature being added OR they come with special ammo already).  This is found under the new "Follower Gear" tab in the MCM.

- Optional Companions Feature (found under System)
-- As requested there are several vanilla NPCs who can now become companions. Some have quest-based requirements to avoid game issues. 
-- You can toggle them on in the MCM. As long as you haven't completed their requirement, you can also toggle them off.
-- If you toggle them on and have not yet completed their requirement, once you do and you enter a new location, they will be enabled (uses Change Location event).
-- If you have already completed their requirement, they should be ready to go immediately.
-- You can recruit and marry Saadia once you have completed the quest "In My Time of Need".
-- You can recruit Ysolda when you have completed the radiant quest to bring her a mammoth tusk.
-- You can recruit and marry Colette, Drevis, Faralda, Nirya, Phinis, Sergius and Tolfdir when you have become the Archmage of Winterhold. This also requires RDO to be fully functional. Without RDO, only Drevis and Faralda will have the required recruit dialogue. Sergius and Tolfdir will require it if you want to marry them.
-- You can recruit and marry several Thieves Guild members if you have defeated Mercer.

- Under Stats, you can now boost Health, Magicka and/or Stamina if it is low for that follower. This is intended to boost them so that you can teach them spells or make a weak follower able to take more damage in combat (and so on).
-- This is limited to a flat one-time bonus, which is up to 175 for Health and Magicka, 100 for Stamina. If the followers Health/Magicka is lower than 175 or Stamina is lower than 100, their stats will be raised by the difference.
-- This isn't perfect because scripting doesn't have access to the Actor's offset in Health, Magicka or Stamina nor does it have access to the stat weights from class, which are multipliers per level. This means that even if you boost a follower this way, if they aren't intended as a mage or warrior via their class, they will eventually lag behind.

MCM CHANGES:
- Under Stats, Health, Magicka and Stamina stats now display total value (in parenthesis) and current value.

- Restructuring of the MCM Interface. This is an ongoing process and has two goals. 1) Better balancing of empty space. 2) Less overwhelming when new features are added (and less overwhelming period for new users). This will hopefully make more sense when you view the menu, but the changes are outlined below.

-- History has been moved to the Slots tab and that tab is now called "Slots & History".
-- Unused (empty) slots are now shown greyed-out (disabled).
-- New tab, "Follower Gear" has been added after Follower Abilities. Headwear and shield equipping options are moved here, under Equipping Actions. The ability to copy the followers base outfit was moved here under Base Outfit. Adventuring gear storage and list has been moved here. This area will have more use in the future.
-- Reorganized space under Follower Tweaks with the clump of tweaks under some different headers for ease of finding things.

- Restructured English Interface strings file.

MOD INSTALLER:
- The FOMOD Installer now detects 3DNPC and RDO and recommends the appropriate options automatically.
- Installer now has the option to install the leveling BAT file.


- Update 2.15
Mostly bug fixes here.

- When imported, the framework now checks Serana's "IsDismissed" flag in regards to removing invalid imported followers. This should help allieviate some issues, such as interactions with Convenient Horses.
- Streamlined additional follower alias code.
- When setting headwear off or only in combat in the MCM for one or more followers, they are checked upon menu exit.
- If a follower has on headwear when setting it to be used only in combat in the MCM, it should be recorded immediately.
- If headwear is part of a follower's adventuring gear and has been stored AND you have their helm to only show in combat, it should be registered automatically when re-recruiting them.
- "OnObjectUnequipped" event has been removed from follower alias code.
- Removed debug message of who gets taunted.
- Expendable Followers dialogue is disabled by default.

- Dragonborn DLC: Fix for quest script (DLC2_QF_DLC2MQ04_020179DE), if Frea is in the party.
- Hearthfires DLC: Fix for quest script if a follower is turned into a steward (BYOHHouseBuildingScript).
- Dawnguard DLC: Fix for a possible radiant quest that can involve your spouse, if they are a follower.

- You can now set thresholds for healing for followers in the healer role, in the MCM menu. The base percent is 65%, meaning that if a target is under 65% health, conditions will be favorable for the healer to heal them. This is somewhat high to adjust for combat reaction time and you should make the same consideration when adjusting values. You can adjust this separately for the player, the follower and for other followers in the party (including temporary teammates).  Raising this value will cause a healer to heal a target more often, on less health loss. Lowering this will have the reverse effect.

- Perk Display: A new perk tab has been added for followers. This will show nearly all the perks available, categorized by the type of skill they belong to. Multiple ranks of perks will show with tier and a number in parenthesis. In the case of perk overhauls, it natively supports vanilla and Ordinator perks. Other overhauls will still display information but may show different tiers as duplicates of the base perk (instead of Armsman (Tier 1), Armsman (Tier 2), you may would see Armsman, Armsman, for example). It may take a second or two to display perks since it has to be implemented manually.

- Spells & Abilities Tab: 

-- Magicka costs are now displayed next to each spell. This cost is relative to the follower being viewed, taking cost reductions from Perks and other abilities into effect.
-- Granted abilities should no longer show effects that come from perks. Basically any "spell" that has a cost, duration and area of 0 is not displayed.

- Heads up: I was checking some spell costs and found a weird bug where the ice spells of my mage were showing as being free to cast (cost of 0). There are some followers out there where the authors have changed the cost of the base spells. This affects all followers and npcs and everything else. I recommend checking downloaded followers in xEdit if you have the time.  What the authors SHOULD be doing is duplicating spells for their followers they want to make changes to and give followers those duplicates.  I also found some cases of follower mods changing cost and effect of shouts...


- Update 2.14
** REQUIRED that you use sort character slots, wait 1 hour, save your game and reload. **

Notations:

- When your game first loads, this mod's startup functions are delayed for a second or two.  Going into game menus during this time may interrupt some functions, so just wait a moment or two. I'm looking into streamlining this in the future.  When loading into a new cell, it may take a second or so to update your follower's gear and this may take a few seconds with a lot of followers who have lots of gear pieces.

Fixes:

- Disable Bleedout Recovery should work properly. Toggle off to allow your followers to recover from bleedout during combat after a short while. Toggle on to keep your followers from recovering during bleedout. They may stay down for quite a while if you have it enabled.
- Fix for CTD when Taunting, hopefully. See changes.
- Speed Boost is off by default for new games to resolve issues with Requiem or other mods that provide speed boost.
- Calm Followers spell no longer applies a light force effect, which could be sensitive to other mods.

Changes:

- Ranger combat style now allows dual wielding (more like pen and paper ranger).  Versus Berserker, the ranger is less offensive and circles/retreats less. Berserker is much more in your face.
- Priest combat style increases chance of staff use, slightly.

- Tweaks for colliding followers (game settings were taken from Move It Dammit by Apogee777, with no permission required). These are automatically applied upon game load:
-- Close follow distance is a bit further out.
-- Range of bump, where followers move out of your way is increased slightly.
-- Bump range is greatly increased when followers are sandboxing.

- Optimized several follower features. Learn Spell, Mount/Dismount, Recharge Weapons and Taunt now run directly on the Alias script instead of the Controller script. These features will work more smoothly, quickly and independently per follower. This will also improve performance overall slightly.

- The application of adventuring gear is done more efficiently. Furthermore, if you don't have gloves/gauntlets, headwear or boots/shoes as part of a follower's gear, the system will attempt to unequip those pieces. This relies on keywords and slots and some modded armor may be using the wrong keywords for the wrong slot (for example, ArmorGauntlets keyword on shoulder parts).  Though an   It is beyond the scope of this mod to fix bad keywords on armor mods but you can easily do this via xEdit or Creation Kit.

- Follower Alias script performance should be better overall.

- Tank Taunt has been optimized. Conditions for checking for a taunt now reduce false positives and possible cases of CTD.  Line of Sight condition has been added to reduce some stress/false positives.  This will fail to taunt opponents that are not in the follower's sight or behind a wall but is a tradeoff for stability.
- You can now choose between 6 different Taunt effect voices. There is higher and lower pitched male and female. This setting is saved to a follower and doesn't need to be reapplied unless you change your mind.

- In the MCM, Resistances have been moved to the (new) Abilities page.

- General overall cleanup of main script.

Features:

- Follower History feature. The last 25 (unique) adventurers that were with the player are now recorded. Via the MCM you can see where each is currently located and fast travel to them, if you wish. You can also elect to port them to you. You can set the history length (number remembered) from 0 to 50. There is slight impact (a second or two) when loading a new game as history is checked (for dead or invalid actors), lessened the lower the history length is. 25 is probably a good balance for most people, higher for follower fiends. 0 will turn the feature off.  Only followers that have been with you from this point onward are recorded.

- Divorce Feature. Though this might be somewhat outside of a follower framework (but maybe not since there are lots of followers with a marriage option), you now have the option of divorcing your spouse. You can enable this feature in the MCM and how a brief conversation with your mate. If you decide on divorce, they will be angry for a little while (4 hours game time) and will brush you off if you try to interact with them. If your spouse is your follower, they will leave your service.  It is unlikely to work properly if you are using a marriage mod that allows for multiple spouses.

- Potion Recovery feature. In much the same way that you can Stimpak a downed ally in Fallout 4, you can now use a potion on a downed follower (bleeding out state).  You can choose to use logic in which potions are used (strongest to weakest or vice versa) or simply pick one potion to use on them. To use, interact with your follower while they are downed and if available you will use a potion on them and they will be taken out of the bleedout state, ready to resume fighting. Only supports health recovery potions available in the vanilla game. This feature runs independently on the alias script, per follower, so should be efficient.

- Revive After Combat. This goes hand-in-hand with the Disable Bleedout Recovery feature of the framework. If a follower is still in a downed state after the player is out of combat, this will attempt to recover them to an unwounded state.

- You can now examine the spells and abilities of a follower. It is split into Base (those that the base actor starts with) and Granted (those which are applied via effects or have been learned from a spellbook). It is not perfect and will show any spells that are applied to a follower via other mods, such as spells granted by perks, perk overhauls and temporary effects). Perks themselves are not listed here until I can figure out an elegant way to implement this (other than creating arrays of hundreds of items to check against, which is likely slow).  The main reason for adding this is to help track what spells you teach your followers.


- Update 2.13

Fixes/Tweaks:

- Increased the delay slightly when checking a follower's gear and so on. This is mainly to help with interference when auto-saving or loading a cell.

- Optimized re-applying framework settings on followers upon game load.

- Incompatibilities resolved for some other follower mods and possible fix for some followers, in general.  The vanilla DialogueFollowerScript has been changed to reference the framework using "GetFormFromFile" for compatibility with followers that use their own quest but have attached this script. 

- If you are using Interesting NPCS, the structure of the replacement follower3dnpc script has been tweaked.

- Fixed a couple of instances where messages where using a follower's true name instead of their nickname, if in use.

- Taunt tweaked for those followers in the framework Tank role. Taunt cost reduced from 20 to 15 stamina and is cast for free at the start of combat.  This should help tanking followers that often make use of power attacks, particularly for 2-handed fighting.

- Nickname feature has been removed. SetDisplayName can cause game issues such as making you unable to interact with renamed actors or game corruption. If you used this feature before, please try to go back to an earlier save where you didn't rename any followers. I had no idea of the level of damage this could cause and it was added to better allow you to customize your follower experience.


Features:

- You can now set Aggression, Assistance, Confidence and Morality for Followers. This is only enforced while they are in your service. These values are recorded in factions specific to the framework so that they can be re-applied when you re-recruit them.

- You can now apply Combat Styles to followers.  There are 10 styles available and you can always set your follower back to the style their started with. There are 4 magic styles, 3 melee styles and 2 ranged styles.  Keep in mind that these styles affect which general categories of weapons they will use, their offensive and defensive AI, ability to strafe or circle opponents and similar behaviors. They don't add new skills, abilities or spells. I tried to include a good mix of offensive and defensive builds and hybrid ones such as Berserker (dual-wield) and Spellsword.  Please refer to the PDF guide for details. A combat style is only applied while the Follower is in your service but is non-destructive to the character "template".

- Combat Styles are applied by affecting the follower's combat package. You can also attempt to use it on an imported follower but there's no guarantee that it will work and if it does may completely change how they function in combat.  It should not break them as you can change it to default to set them back to their default combat package.

- Imported followers can now benefit from Combat Role and Combat Distance IF you are using a Combat Style on them.


- Update 2.12

Fixes:

- Possible fix for odd follower issues that some folks are having. With this fix, I'm going to strongly recommend that you have USSEP installed for Skryim SE or USLEEP installed for Skyrim LE. This removes the "Uses Stored Text" flag from the Aliases in this mod, which might be helpful for some people. We will see.  Rebuilt the SEQ files for both games, just in case.

- Improved Follower Horse Dismounting. Followers are more responsive in dismounting when the player dismounts. If a follower is somehow stuck on horseback, if you mount then dismount, they should dismount their horse. Only applies to horses provided to followers via this mod.

- Stored gear now automatically is re-applied when re-recruiting a Follower. Only applies to stored Adventuring Gear.

- Mod updates should now only show once. When the mod is first installed, you should only see installed once (this is correction to a general issue with the game when using OnInit).  Rebuilt versioning routine.

- Bleedout Recovery setting the MCM has now been reversed. It used to be "Enable Bleedout Recovery" but is now "Disable Bleedout Recovery".  If enabled, blledout recovery during battle will be turned off for followers. The default setting is now off.

Features:

- You can now give any follower a Nickname. This changes the name that is displayed in game (not their "true" name). It is permanent but can be reversed by setting their nickname to an empty name or using "none" as the name. When giving a nickname you can be creative and spaces are accepted. This is intended to be used with guards or other expendable recruits but can be used on virtually anyone. Note that there may be some followers who are part of a quest that might change their display name. This setting is found on the Follower page in the MCM. Technical info: This only changes the Follower's "display name" not their "true name" and you can always revert them to their original name by clearing the nickname entry in the MCM.

- Notifications by the Framework show Follower nicknames where applicable.

- New debug feature, Expel Follower. This allows you to dismiss a Follower, even if she is not in the framework for some reason. It can be enabled in the MCM under System and shows an additional dialogue choice, "I no longer need your help (Expel)." Though it is for helping users with issues, you can use it in place of the regular "Dismiss" option, as it will remove Followers from the framework if they are in it.

- You can now control Idle Chatter of followers. This setting is in two places. The main setting is found in the Interaction menu of the MCM and allows you to choose between On, Off and only when Sandboxing. The second setting can be set on a per-Follower basis to only affect certain followers. Setting the main setting to Off, will affect all followers, regardless of their individual setting. Followers will still comment if you bump into them, are in combat or are told to speak through an event (dangerous enemy, seeing a cave, etc).  Idle Chatter settings will not affect Custom Followers.

Changes:

- Some abilites have been removed from the framework, as they now exist on the Command Followers ability. This is an attempt to streamline the mod a bit. Removed: Set Adventuring Gear and Summon Followers.

- Reset Follower Quest has been changed to Restart Main Quests. This feature, in the MCM, will remove all of the followers from the framework, reset their factions to a state before they were following you, clear all the aliases from the vanilla follower quest and the import followers quest.  Hopefully this will provide a better reset if you need to use it.

- The framework now has a well organized readme in the form of a pdf that has been written from the ground up. The update list is now a separate text file.


- Update 2.11 - 

Fixes:

- Expendable Recruits Tweaks:
-- Recruited Bards that are singers no longer attempt to change location to auto-start singing songs. This is done with the "BardSingerNoAutostart" faction and is only temporary while they are in your service.
-- Only Unique Non-essential NPCs can be set to essential. Also, Uniques set this way can be rehired.
-- The following features are blocked from Levelled NPCs (Guards, Soldiers, etc that have no unique name): Storing Adventuring Gear, Set Essential (as above) and Learning Spells. This is a cautionary measure, just in case derived actors from a base actor could be affected.  You can still do other things like set their role, mount, etc because you can always change it if it causes a minor issue.

- Adventuring Gear/Shield/Headwear Tweaks:
-- Conflict resolved that caused Adventuring Gear to make a Follower naked upon entering a new cell.
-- Shield and Headwear properly stored when exiting MCM menu (if those features activated).
-- Shield correctly detected and hidden on cell load/exiting combat.
-- Updated storage function of headwear and shield.

- Corrected some Papyrus errors concerning the GetName function.

- Enemies that are bleeding out are not counted for purposes of allowing a Tank to Taunt. Also, bleeding out enemies are not affected (irrelevent, they can't move or attack anyways).


- Update 2.1 -

Fixes:
- "building charge" no longer shows when auto-recharging weapons, it was for internal use.
- Removing the adventuring gear dialogue in the MCM should also actually remove the dialogue.
- Adventure gear slot labels are now accurate.
- If a follower has died and somehow remains in the framework, sorting the slots will remove it.
- No longer accidentally adds some animals to the framework when looting. This happened because skyrim adds some animals, such as stray dogs, automatically as party members/pets when interacting with them, including examining a dead body.
- Bleedout setting is now applied to all followers upon game load.
- Sorting Slots function removed from new installations.
- Helmet should be removed more consistently after combat, if using that option.
- Helmet from an outfit is stored as the current helm, if using that option.
- Allow Bleedout Recovery now is properly set in the MCM menu.

Changes:
- Taunt Ability Changes.
-- New visual and audio. Audio is different between male and female followers.
-- No longer knocks down physics-enabled objects.
-- Reinforced that only hostile targets are affected.
- Verbose Activity setting in the MCM removed and split into toggles for Taunt, Recharge, Heal, Storage of Headwear and Learning Spells. Found under System in the MCM.
- You are notified if a Follower cannot learn a spell from a book, if toggled under MCM.
- Headwear stored only displays if toggled under MCM.


New:
- Command Follower ability redesigned.
-- If facing a Follower, a menu specific to her will appear (they will glow slightly). Follower can be commanded to Wait/Follow, Trade, Favor, Set (Adventuring) Gear or be Dismissed. Wait can be set to perpetual (and sandbox). Favor brings up the game command cursor (they will stop doing a favor if you escape out). Fires an invisible projectile to target the Follower, so can be used fairly far away.
-- If no follower is under your crosshair, a menu shows up that affects ALL followers.  In the "All Followers" menu, you can have them all Wait/Follow, Toggle Sandbox, Combat/Follow distance, Summon, Dismiss.  If you accidentally have targeted a follower but you wish to issue commands to all of them, you can use "All" to go to this menu.

- Allow Expendable Recruits feature added.
-- You can now recruit non-essential, non-protected NPCs as followers. Typically, this is more useful for guards or soldiers, but any expendable townsperson can be recruited. This is more of a novelty feature but can be used for immersion purposes. It is experimental at this time (doubtful it will break your game).
-- You do this via a dialogue by bribing them with gold. The more gold you offer, the greater the chance they will join you. If they deny your bribe, you cannot attempt it again for 2 hours in-game time (dialogue will auto-fail).
-- Once recruited, they are added to the framework and most features will work on them. They will be added to their own faction (for tracking/dialogue purposes) and not to the vanilla current follower/potential follower factions. They are protected like any other follower in the framework. Does not alter any vanilla dialogue, they use their own custom "follower" lines from shared dialogue.
-- Some townsfolk will have their vanilla dialogues, so use your best judgement when interacting with them. For example, an innkeeper will have the rent a room dialogue but if you are far away from the inn, it's best to avoid selecting that.  Children can be recruited if you have a mod that allows them to be killable but will not fight unless you have a mod that enables this.
-- You can dismiss an Expendable Recruit as normal. However, if you dismiss them in an area where there are opposing faction members, there may be chaos.
-- Eventually, hiring the same NPC over and over will make them comfortable with adventuring with you, especially if you have been generous with the gold when hiring them.  When this happens, the recruit dialog will change to "Care to join me again?".  This can take between 2 and 5 rehires.
-- Someone suggested this idea and I felt there were a lot of RP possibilities and a lot of ways to use NPCs to do things differently in game.  Example 1: You normally only have 1, maybe 2, followers and there's a tough fight ahead. You bribe a nearby guard to help you fight. Example 2: Considering you have the appropriate mods (children can fight, killable children, etc), you take your son along with you in a few of your adventures to help him learn to be a tough warrior.

- A text batch file is available, optionally, if you need to make a follower level with the player, in the event that they don't already. This text file needs to be placed in your main skyrim directory. This is particularly useful if you are using "Allow Expendable Recruits" and you want a more competent companion. To use, open the console, target the NPC and type: bat nfflevel
-- It only needs to be used once on an NPC and will cause them to match the player's level, level with you and set maximum level to 100.
-- If at any point ConsoleUtil is ported to SSE, I will integrate this into the framework.

- A new option under Sandboxing (in the MCM), allows Followers (and other NPCs) to sandbox between multiple levels of buildings.  Off by default.

- New option, Shield only in Combat, causes Followers to unequip their shield when not in combat.

- Update 2.0

- Fixes -

- Followers now more reliably update their adventuring gear when entering a new cell.
- Some general fixes and improvements across the board.

- Updates -

- Reworked the MCM menu for layout. The "General" page is now split into "Interaction" and "System". Interaction more or less affects the interactivity of Followers. System is more along the lines of core features, support and abilities for the player.
- Some items in the MCM menu have been renamed and the new pages have new categories. Their functions are essentially the same unless otherwise noted. Hope nobody gets confused or triggered but it looks better.
- New mod versions will automatically sort follower slots upon game load (after version update notification).
- Sandboxing now has a dropdown to switch between Off, Allow, Allow with Autoboxing in Town or Allow with Autobox at Home, as they use the same global with different values anyways.
- When choosing a storage slot for Adventuring Gear, you now have the option to cancel. If is the first entry (- Cancel -).

- Features -

- Reduce Infighting is a new setting in MCM under "Combat" that attempts to keep followers from fighting each other when they use spells with hazard or area effects. It instructs them to stop fighting if they are targeting a teammate. Turn this off if you actually need to fight a follower for some odd reason.
- You can now set the Catch Up Teleport distance and time checking interval in the MCM menu under "Movement".
- Verbose Activity is a new setting under "Actions" that you can turn on or off. If on, you will be notified if a Follower heals you, recharges their weapon or taunts.
- You can now set your Followers to automatically recharge their weapons via a dropdown menu.  Followers recharge at a flat value (150 points) with a bonus based on their own Enchanting skill. This occurs more often in large combat scenarios but generally is between 2 or 3 combat events. There is a flash, similar to an armor spell, when they recharge their weapons. Even if auto recharge is being used, you can still give Followers filled soul gems to double-down on their recharge capability.
- Big Role update, there is now a Tank role available. Follower must have a minimum Stamina of 40 and works best with someone who has block ability (shield or 2-handed weapon), though you could have a mage tank if it amuses you.  When in Tank Role, the Follower will periodically do an AoE Taunt around herself that will do a small amount of damage to hostiles and try to direct them to her. Taunting costs 40 stamina and can only be done every 15 seconds. While Taunt is on cooldown, the Tank receives a buff that increases her Health by 100 and her Blocking skill by 10 (these are flat bonuses because there's no other safe way to do it right now).
- Taunting will only occur if the Tank is relatively close to the Player. Taunting may not pull the enemy off of you if you continue to engage that enemy and at times the enemy AI will do what it wants to anyways. It might be best to have one Tank, otherwise Followers will Taunt off of each other constantly.  Taunting doesn't favor stronger opponents or do anything super-smart but the Follower will not taunt if no enemies are around.

- Update 1.9

- Adventuring Gear formlists (slots) have been reworked and are now more reliable. GetItemCount is also not used as it gives false positives when using leveled gear. In other words, Followers should no longer forget Adventuring Gear you've assigned to them.
- Updated methods are used to record Adventuring Gear so that player-customized gear is used where possible. If you are using enchanted (by the player) or smith-improved gear, make sure that the Follower you set this up is not also carrying non-enchanted/smithed versions. We still have to use formlists to record the base form of each item and this can be fooled if your Follower is carrying 3 pairs of leather boots, with only one of them enchanted (for example). Object References (that you find and use in-game) can only be "stored" in chests and I'm not at the point where I'm going to add 25 chests to hold and check against all the gear Followers are wearing and have stored. Will cross that bridge if it becomes necessary.
- A Follower's Gear list will show it's base names, not custom names. This is just a limit on how things are displayed.

- Followers can recharge their weapons with soul gems, option is under General in the MCM and off by default. You may give a follower any number of filled soul gems (must not be player filled and the ones you buy from merchants or find in the world). After combat they will fill their weapons using the lowest filled gems first (order goes petty, lesser, common, greater, grand, black). They will not overfill weapons and will wait until it's charge is expended enough to fit a full gem's worth of energy. Recharging has a cooldown of about 2 game hours (6 minutes real time). When a Follower recharges their weapon or have no more gems in their inventory to use, you will be notified. You are also notified if you trade a soul gem with them that they cannot use (player filled gems or special quest gems). The gem limitations are game-based.

- There is a new player power that can be activated in the MCM, under general. Calm Followers allows you to calm all Followers around you (2048 units). They will stop combat and have their aggression lowered for 60 seconds. This is identical to Voice of the Emperor except that it can be used at-will and only affects Followers and teammates.

- Reworked Sandbox routine to be more snappy. You can now set the Relaxing Time in the MCM, which is the number of seconds the player must settle before followers will sandbox around.
- Followers can now be set to Automatically sandbox while in any interior city or town building. You can also opt to only have them auto sandbox in your homes. While sandboxing in this way, they will continue to do their own thing while you move around in the building. However, there are several "breakers" that will cause them to automatically follow you directly again: drawing a weapon, being in combat, moving 4096 units away from them or moving into an exterior location.
- You can define a location to be a Custom Sandbox Location in the MCM menu, under General. If using Sandbox only in Town or Auto Sandbox in Town, Followers will include this location as also eligible. The option only shows if you are currently in a location that is supported and is not already defined as a city, town or home location (via keywords). This option can be used to have followers sandbox Fort Dawnguard, for example.

- The General MCM page has been reworked to better accomodate available space.
- There are a couple new game settings added to help with follower positioning: iNumberActorsAllowedToFollowPlayer (set to 15), fFollowExtraCatchUpSpeedMult (set to 5.0).
- Checking outfits, horse and helmets are more performance friendly (Follower Alias script).
- Horse packages have been tweaked to no longer cause odd following issues.
- Some functions where adjusted to work better when keeping horses around under General of the MCM menu.
- Several alias package functions are tweaked and should perform better.
- MCM changes that affect real-world appearances (horse skins, effects, etc) are now cached as you pick them and carried out once the MCM menu is closed.
- Going in and out of sandboxing is now more reliable.
- Auto warp is now more reliable.

* It is a good idea to use Sort Follower Slots on the slots tab of the MCM menu after installing this update. If you were using Adventuring Gear, you should redo those assignments if those Followers weren't reapplying their gear properly.

- Update 1.8

Fixes:

- When setting a follower's Adventure Gear, custom enchants and naming are no longer removed. Improved SKSE functions are now used. When enchanting a follower's gear, you should set up their Adventure Gear again.

Features:

- Horse options have been somewhat overhauled.
-- In the MCM under General, Allow Horses was replaced with "Mount Support". There are 4 possible choices: No Support, Spawned Horses and Riding Support Only. No support provides no horse support at all (Convenient Horses). Spawned Horses spawns horses for Followers (unless they are excluded) and gives them access to riding packages. Riding Support Only just provides riding packages without spawning any horses (Immersive Horses). It is possible to have some followers spawn horses and some not and still use riding packages, see below.
-- In the MCM under Followers, Allowed to Use Horse set to off will still give a follower access to horse riding packages.  Keep in mind that if you are using Immersive Horses, mixing and matching between spawned and not spawned horses might confuse some followers.
-- Follower Horse FX - You can now apply special effects to a follower's horse when using spawned horses. There are 4 possible effects: Fire, Frost, Ghost and Shadow. Special effects will combine with horse skins and are remembered on a per-follower basis.
-- Followers will move quickly to a horse when the player mounts.
-- Spawned Horses now appear away from the player.
-- When switching a follower to not use a spawned horse, the horse vanishes.
-- You can keep spawned horses around, under General, for immersion. If a horse is too far away when the player mounts, it will be summoned.

- Update 1.7

Fixes:

- Followers Close, Medium, Far Follow ranges adjusted for non-combat and combat. All are somewhat closer relative to their previous values.
- Followers now properly set to use a Horse by default when first recruited (fixed again).
- Fixed a couple of bugs when using the Command Power to command a single follower.
-- Followers correctly cycle in the order of their follower slots.
-- The correct follower is selected when issuing a command.
-- Dismiss no longer accidentally dismisses more than one follower.
- MCM now correctly shows Mods that are internally supported instead of "$" variables.
- MCM text hopefully makes more sense and is corrected in some places.
- Circlets should now be supported when using Headwear only in Combat.

Features:

- Followers now switch faster between Run and Walk states, off by default. Set in the MCM General menu.
- Followers should react faster when told to wait or follow.

- Force Equipment has a slight re-design.
-- Now referring to it as "Adventuring Gear", as in the gear your follower wears while in your company, versus their normal gear. This sounds more fanciful and less scientific that "Force Equipment" did.
-- You no longer need to trade with a follower to take their previous Adventuring Gear back. When setting up gear, their currently used items are removed and placed in the trading pane. This also allows you to quickly refresh their Adventure Gear, if you need to, by using the dialog (or power, below) then canceling.
-- Adventuring Gear items are listed in the MCM menu under the Followers page, for that Follower.
-- You can removing gear managment from a Follower from the same page.
-- There are now 15 storage slots you can use for Adventuring Gear. These slots memorize the gear you define and are used to automatically re-apply their Adventuring Gear if you dismiss and then recruit them later. A slot's contents automatically updates if you change what gear they are using.  When using the slots dropdown, clicking on the slot of a different Follower than the one you are viewing will replace that slot with the current Follower. If a slot is already defined, clicking on a different empty slot will move the Follower's slot to that position. Followers will eventually use their Default Outfit shortly after being dismissed - storage has no effect on that.
-- Though the dialogue option remains, you have the option of using a fire and forget power to set up gear for a Follower. This can be activated in the MCM and assigned as a favorite with SkyUI if you wish.  To use, just face the Follower and press the Power/Shout key (Z).
-- Backing out of setting up equipment for a Follower to wear no longer clears their Forced Equipment.
-- The dialogue option is still available if you want to use it that way. However, it now leads directly to the trading pane.

- The Show Forced gear dialogue option has been removed and is now listed in the MCM.
- Clone Outfit dialogue option has been removed and is now listed in the MCM.
- If a Follower uses Headwear only in Combat, that item is shown in the MCM.

- Followers can be taught spells by trading spell books with them (beta). It is off by default and can be set in the MCM under General.
-- When trading a spell book, if the follower doesn't have the spell AND has enough magicka to cast it, they will learn the spell.  If the spell is learnt, the book is consumed. Trading books offering that same spell (or multiple copies of the same book) in the future will trade the book to them as normal.
-- You are notified if the Follower actually learns the spell ("Serana learns Firecloak", for example).
-- Learning a spell doesn't necessarily mean the Follower will cast it and this is determined by the AI engine in the game. Followers will use these kinds of spells most of the time: direct damage spells (destruction), summoning spells (conjuration), healing spells that will heal themselves (restoration), armor/cloak spells (alteration) and possibly others. I would avoid allowing Followers to learn "bound item" spells as it used to cause CTD - it is unknown to me if it still does, I don't use those spells.
-- It should work fine with mods that add new spells to the game as long as those spells can be learned from books AND the book has the "VendorItemSpellTome" keyword (can be bought or sold to a vendor).
-- Avoid teaching spells to Followers that are solely intended for the player or are part of a mod to add some kind of spell/feature to the player (only).


- Update 1.6

- Support for Interesting NPCs. There is an option in the FOMOD. Replaces one script of iNPC.  They will work like vanilla followers.
- Fixed an issue where the first 4 followers would not use the Healing role.
- Followers are now set to use a horse by default if horses are enabled.
- Spacing between followers increases when mounted and returns when dismounted.
- Reversed a change. Dismiss all Followers no longer removes imported followers. Was causing issues with some custom followers.


- Update 1.5
(Categorized changes)
It is recommended that you sort the character slots OR dismiss and re-recruit your existing followers after this update.

General:
- The 5 Follower + 5 Animal Slots are more flexible, turning them into 10 total Slots. Now able to recruit 10 Followers or Pets total, your choice of mixing them. You shouldn't need to dismiss/re-recruit your current roster. However, it might be a good idea to sort the character slots via the MCM.
- Slots are now displayed as "1st" through "10th". It still fills slots from high to low but to avoid confusion, full words are used with "1st" meaning the first available slot (or slot being looked at).
- You can now set Followers to not recover from bleedout during a fight until combat ends. This does not persist if you dismiss them, only while they are in your service. Under general in MCM.
- Equipped items via Force Equipment now moves between Followers when using Sort Aliases.
- Creating a copy of an outfit no longer has a one-time use.
- Restructed some of the procedures of the Healer package to make it work more reliably.
- Many internal fixes and tweaks.
- You can remove (or add) the "Summon Followers" power via the MCM.
- Imported Followers are now removed from the Framework when dismissed, either via their own dismiss dialogue or by the Command power. You will need to wait a few moments as they need to be detected that they are not in the Framework.
- Readme hopefully more in line with recent changes.
- If the player is mounted and Catch-up is enabled (or Summon Followers is used), Followers will warp to the player.  If Horses are enabled for Followers, they will attempt to mount them.

Dialogue:
- New (immersive) equipment menu shown near "I need you to trade some things" when speaking to a follower. Force equipment, Show Forced Equipment and Copy Equipment features are here. You can turn this dialog on/off in the MCM.
- Recruit as blade is shown in the main follower dialogue if you are at a certain point in the Blades quest where you can recruit Blades. You can hide it by using the MCM if you don't care about the Blades.
- "Remove from Framework" is now shown on the main dialogue of a follower (near the bottom) if they have been imported.

MCM:
- MCM is more robust with updated descriptions. Can now set defaults of most items.
- Follower/Import Follower settings moved to MCM as the Follower page.
- Show Stats moved to the MCM, showing all Skills and Resistances. On it's own Stats page.
- You can toggle between followers on either page, above.
- New language strings added for MCM and for scripts to make it easier for translations. Due to the way strings work, not all of them can be converted over.
- Some MCM toggles now work more reliably.

Horses:
- Potential number horses increased to 10, one for each humanoid follower.
- You can now pick the skin of Follower horses (MCM) globally, between Brown, Black, Black and White, Grey, Palomino, Shadow or Cairn.
- You can now set a horse's skin specifically for any Follower. Choice is remember even if you dismiss them and recruit them later.
- Horses are set to ignore friendly fire.
- Horses don't affect stealth meter (if they have remained for some reason).
- Mounting and Dismount functions/packages are more responsive, especially with sandboxing turned off.
- If the player enters combat while mounted and Followers dismount, their horses will disappear so that they aren't in the way.
- Followers will attempt to summon horses if the player is mounted during combat and combat ends.


- Update 1.4.1 - (The hotfix episode)

FIXES:
- Horses that die by being pulled into combat are now resurrected when a follower attempts to call a horse. Combat monitoring is not being implemented at this time. Keep in mind that Follower horses are only to solve a transportation issue for followers and may resist (or break) being customized by other mods. Will look into some quality of life features but this is not a horse mod.
- Implemented a simple catch-all for false positives when recruiting some followers. Some follower mods that work into the vanilla system can have their own ideas about recruitment/dismissal and you might see false "Come with me, I need your help" type options even though the follower is already with you and in the Framework. This just adds another check to keep it from double-recruiting and so on. Fixes some papyrus errors as well.
- Removing Follower no longer resets "don't use helm" faction. You might need to reset "Only Use Helm in Combat" on previously dismissed Followers.
- Equipment is not checked (force equip) when Follower changes location - it is spammy. Instead, OnAttachedToCell event is used, added slight delay.
- Equipment, when checked (force equip), is now quickly unequipped then equipped to hold the change.
- Followers no longer try to keep a constant speed while mounted.
- Fixed some menu dialog issues where items might lead back to the wrong section.

FEATURES:
- Create Copy of Default Outfit: You can now create a copy of your Follower's default outfit. The intent here is to allow you to enchant or temper armor on a follower that you don't have access to. This could be very unsafe or weird depending on who you use this on, so use with caution! For now, to prevent the temptation to dupe items, you can only make a copy of a Follower's outfit one time.

CHANGES:
- Called Horses have a speed boost to help keep up with the player (+25%).

- Update 1.4 - (Now Requires SkyUI)

FIXES:
- Fixed an issue when detemining number of Animal Followers. Was stopping at 2. Correctly counts to 5.
- Some bug fixes here and there.

FEATURES:
- Phase One of MCM Menu support. Not everything is there yet as I am very new to it.  All General Options are in MCM. All Follower and Pet Slots and Sorting Slots is in MCM.
- English translation file included for MCM features. Those wishing to translate to other languages can use this file.
- Horse System is now available to Followers (yes, works with Imported Followers). This is a new, beta feature. This is just a simple system for those that don't want to use the beefier horse mods. When you mount up, your followers summon a horse and ride it. When you dismount, followers do as well and their horses disappear. Horse colors alternate between the darker horse skins. It's likely going to stay simple with possibly setting horse skins in the future.  Followers will not fast travel on horses.

CHANGES:
- When Sandboxing, followers now sandbox around themselves (768 units) instead of the player. They will also attempt to move away if getting too close. This causes them to collide into the player far less.

- Update 1.3 -

FIXES:
- Fix for Pressure Plates being set off by some Followers (Meeko! Why?).
- Fixed a CTD caused by Hide Headwear applying changes before 3D loaded into the cell.
- Fixed Controller Script from attempting to use an invalid Reference Alias (cleared Papyrus errors).
- Follower/Pet Death now shuts down the NPC properly. Really only important if the player wants to resurrect a follower using the console.

FEATURES:
- Force Equipment slightly redesigned. It still forces items to be equipped as before. However, it also stores equipped items in a list. When the player loads a new save game or changes loaction, they will equip these items if they are in their inventory.  This will give Force Equipment a similar behavior to Outfit management.  You should re-apply forced equipment if you used an earlier version.
- You can check which equipment is marked to be forced under the main tweaks menu.

CHANGES: 
- Reduced Hide Headwear unequip time to 4 seconds (down from 6).
- When using Hide Headwear, changing locations/loading the game it may take up to 2 seconds to allow headwear to update.
- When teleporting to the player in an exterior cell, followers won't appear as close.
- Added Equipment/Helmet cleanup for Dismiss/Remove Follower.
- Followers/Pets attempt to slow down when approaching the player to help prevent them from slamming into you. Does not affect Imported Followers. This is not working fully as intended so is a work in progress.
- Entry for Force Equipment changed in the readme.
- "Actions" text changed to "Options" in the menus.


- Update 1.2 -

CHANGES:
- Follow Distance between Followers and the Player now feels more logical as the default space between followers game setting is now adjusted. You should notice a distinct difference between Close, Medium and Far now. Affects the fFollowSpaceBetweenFollowers game setting.
- Combat Distance also adjusted as above. Affects the fCombatTeammateFollowRadiusBase and fCombatTeammateFollowRadiusMin game settings.
- Force Equipment and Show Stats is now moved to the main "Follower Tweaks" branch so that it is quicker to access them. Settings related items remain in a submenu.
- Force Equipment now allows a wider variety of equippable items.

FEATURES:
- You can now set any follower to hide their headwear when out of combat. Setting is found under the Follower Options menu. Once enabled, trade any headwear item with them and you should receive the message "Headwear Stored for (NPC)" and they will remove it once you exit the trading menu. If you dismiss the follower then later recruit them you will have to trade the headwear item again with them again. Also works with Force Equipment, though the headwear will not be force equipped once the npc removes it. Does not affect headwear assigned through a follower's default outfit.
- It is now much harder to have incidents of Friendly Fire in combat. iFriendHitCombatAllowed has been raised from 4 to 15.
- You can now set Followers to not draw their weapons when you draw yours. This can be set under General. It is a global setting and also affects any temporary teammates.

- Update 1.1.1 -

FIXES
- The Framework now prevents the same actor (Animal or Follower) from being added to Follower Slots by doing a quick check prior to Recruitment. This is a quick fix for allowing stray dogs as animal followers so that they don't keep adding in multiple times. This fixes animals such as Meeko. I tested this with Garm for SSE and he would need a small patch to finesse the "Garm joins you message", which I need permission to create (he isn't actually recruited more than once).
- Real-Time Count Check adjusted for Pets.
- Note that version number is still 1.1, internally, so there's no update message.

- Update 1.1 -

FIXES
- Follower Aliases are now all set to Protected.
- When recruiting a Follower for the first time, you aren't told that they are in the default role.
- Corrected a bug in the Healer AI.
- Improved Stealth AI behavior, crouching delay removed.
- Fixed an issue where you could only recruit 2 Blades.
- Added check for current follower to Import Follower.
- Force Equipment no longer makes a follower naked if you don't put items on the equipment side.

FEATURES:
- Can now set Followers to Essential (or revert them to their previous status).  If a Follower is Essential by default, there is nothing to see. Keep in mind that anyone following you is Protected via their alias, so they will always show as protected under show stats. This change persists if you dismiss the follower. Use with caution.
- Framework now supports 5 Animal Slots (I am calling "Pet Slots"). Like Follower slots they fill from high to low, so you'll fill slot 5 first. These slots are separate from Follower Slots. They can use nearly all the benefits that Followers have under this Framework. You cannot set their role or force their equipment. Pets will also ignore friendly fire and you can issue them commands. Custom Followers that you download and happen to be animals can often be Imported and if so, will not use a Pet Slot, they will use a Follower Slot.  In other words, all custom followers are treated the way under Import.
- Command Follower ability added. You can issue commands to all followers via a quick menu - Wait, Follow, Summon and Dismiss. You can also issue these commands to any single follower (or pet) - it starts with the first follower you recruited and then you can cycle through them.
- When selecting Wait via Command Follower, you can elect to choose Vanilla Wait or Perpetual Wait.  Perpetual Wait lasts forever and causes a Follower to sandbox the area.

CHANGES:
- Essential, Protected or Not Protected is shown under Show Stats. Remember that since all Followers and Pets are protected, this can show false positive as "Protected".
- A Follower in Healing Role will now heal the Player out of combat.
- Removed Gather All Followers function. Didn't really do anything exceptional or useful.
- Removed All Followers submenu under Follower Tweaks. Redundant with Command Follower ability.
- Count checking updated to check/adjust animal count.
- You can now show Follower Slots and Pet Slots, each under a separate menu.
- If you sort followers, it will sort both Followers and Pets, regardless of where you select it from.
- Several code changes. Some of this is optimization, some to allow pets.


- Update 1.0 -

- Added an optional Movement Speed Boost, raising following speed by 25%. Can be toggled under General. Also affects Imported Followers.
- Followers have Stealth AI enhancements. While the player is stealthing they will move into close range and not react to combat or combat alerts unless the player enters combat or they are attacked. While stealthing they will not speak idles or engage in world interactions. This only affects non-combat AI. Steath can be toggled globally in General.
- Imported Followers now benefit from the Framework's Stealth AI (above) and Sandboxing (if active under General), moving out of the way and Gather All Followers.
- Imported Followers now have their own Imported Tweaks menu instead of Follower Tweaks. Removing an Imported Follower from the Framework is now also under this menu rather than the Follower menu.
- Any follower can have their Stealth AI and Sandboxing turned off (or on) individually.
- Note: With the options above, you may wish to turn off Sandboxing or Stealth AI for those followers that you know have their own features in that department. For example, Serana has her own Sandboxing and it's going to be active regardless of the settings in the Framework.
- Moved Bump (Flee) Procedure up on the follower package to help prevent followers from bumping into the player.
- Healer role healing has a 6 second cooldown to prevent it from being spammy. Player healing is verbose.

- Now compatible with vanilla Blades Quest recruitment.
- If the Blades Recruitment dialogue is available from Delphine and you wish to make a current follower a blade: Under the follower menu, choose Set as Blades Recruit.  Talk to Delphine and tell her you have a recruit.
- You now have the option placing all the Blades equipment in their inventory versus forcing them to wear the Blades outfit as it works in vanilla. This is toggled under General.

- Restructured menus.
- Condensed Stats sheet.

- Update 0.6 -

- Healers no longer thank themselves when self healing.
- Minor error in Healing AI corrected.
- Summon Followers now has a 0.5 second cast time.
- Follower Package - Followers no longer observe corpses or combat behavior (closer to vanilla there).
- Added many more statistics to Show Stats.
- Increased Ranges for Combat Package. Medium is identical to vanilla exterior/interior range.
- Adjusted Following Ranges.
- Added Catch-up Mechanism (similar to Jenna). If the player is far ahead of followers, they can warp to his/her position. Polls for conditions once per 10 seconds, single timer. Script load is light. Can be toggled on/off under General.
