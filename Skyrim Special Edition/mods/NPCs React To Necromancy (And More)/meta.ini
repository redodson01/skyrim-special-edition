Or not, since it's optional. More info below. \n<br />[center][b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]Video Showcase\n<br />[/size][/b][size=4]\n<br />[/size][/center][center][youtube]9yxOuR1Psbk[/youtube][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3] Consequences: \n<br />[/size][/b]\n<br />Repercussions are completely OPTIONAL. If you choose to have them on, they follow these rules:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]If you cast a [b]normal summon (not UNDEAD)[/b] around NPCs, they might react shocked or distrusful, but there are no consequences.\n<br />[*]If you summon a dead thrall or a skeleton,etc. around NPCs however, there is a chance it affects how the NPC sees you from then on:\n<br />[/list]               - Around 80% of the time: NPCs will react shocked or confused, unsure of what's going on... But no special consequence, just the reaction.\n<br />               - Around 20% of the time: They might realize you're a [s]filthy[/s] necromancer and start hating on you.\n<br />      ﻿﻿Basically: Their relationship rank with you will decrease to a maximum of -1. This does [b][u]not[/u] [/b]affect friends/followers/family members. In    ﻿   ﻿   ﻿terms of gameplay, it means they will remember you are a necromancer and be rude when talking to you in the future.\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Guards will warn you to cut it out, and SOME of them might even attempt to arrest you if you don't leave/stop. Most guards won't go this far though, but the more you provoke them, the bigger the chance they try to arrest you.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][img]https://i.imgur.com/a8rBn2p.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]〜Andrew, Ares, Macpherb, Red Nick〜\n<br />[/size][size=2]&amp; everyone who is supporting me on Patreon or via other means\n<br />Thank you! Your support means a lot!\n<br />[/size][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][/center][size=3][center][img]https://i.imgur.com/0DhnyTT.png[/img][/center][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Are consequences enabled by default?[/b]\n<br />Yes, they don't really interfere much with the game but they're a nice touch, so I recommend leaving them on.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- I only want reactions. How do I disable consequences?[/b]\n<br />You can install the optional plugin to disable the consequences, or you can do it yourself by typing: \"set Reactions_Guard to 2\" in the console after installing the mod. Same result either way.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Are there any consequences to using non-necromancy related spells?[/b]\n<br />No. There are certain reactions to those conjuration spells, but no consequences.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- What are some examples of lines in the mod?\n<br />[/b]Some of the best are probably... \"That's disgusting, get that rotten corpse away from me!\" / \"You've got quite the creepy companion there.\" / That... thing... is unnatural!\". There are lots of examples in the images of the mod, but do let me know if you hear a cool line in-game you want to share!\n<br />\n<br />[b]- I don't play as a necromancer, is the mod worth installing?[/b]\n<br />I would say yes. Necromancy related lines take about 70% of the new lines, but 30% of the remaining lines are general shock or even specific lines connected to certain spells (eg: [i]Sure, sure! Why not summon an atronach to cause some chaos, great idea!!)\n<br />\n<br />[/i][b]- Guards don't seem to want to arrest me?\n<br />[/b]As explained above, it's based on random chance. The more you \"provoke\" the guard resurrecting undead around them, the more chances they will decide enough is enough.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Splicing? Xvasynth?\n<br />[/b]I don't use Xvasynth. No offense to mod authors that do, I just really like splicing. All my mods use only spliced lines. I'd argue most of the reactions in the mod are pretty natural (I try my best!), but feel free to give the mod a try and hear for yourself. Reach out if you think a line needs more love.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- How does the mod work technically?\n<br />[/b]It just uses the vanilla idle (and hello) line system, with conditions that check if you have an undead summon with you. It works similar to the \"player is naked\" comments you get in vanilla. Arrest chance is an alias with an AIpackage.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Performance?\n<br />[/b]It just uses the vanilla dialogue system, as mentioned above. 0 performance worries. \n<br />\n<br />[b]- What's the arrest like?\n<br />[/b]Guard will talk to you, weapon in hand, and you can use persuasion, intimidation or your status as a thane to get the guards to look the other way. If nothing works, you can try to fight them and escape or go to prison for being a [s]filthy[/s] necromancer.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- NPCs had many reactions at the beginning, but they stop reacting after some time. How comes?\n<br />[/b]All lines have a cool-down timer. The shock of seing undead can only last so long lol. Give them an hour, they'll be surprised again. Also: if you want to directly trigger a reaction, you can talk to the NPCs.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Is this marked ESL? Can I install this mid-game?\n<br />[/b]Yep! Yep!\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Compatible with...?\n<br />[/b]Yep! Pretty sure! No vanilla records were edited.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Did you... change your Nexus avatar?\n<br />[/b]Yes haha. It's not amazing but it'll do for now. It's a J... and a S that resembles the Skyrim logo, lol! JohnSkyrim, please don't report me to the guards.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67930][i]\n<br />\n<br />[/i][/url]\n<br />[center][i]-\n<br />This mod is now included in\n<br />[/i][url=https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/qdurkx][img]https://i.imgur.com/YfgAA8V.png[/img][/url]﻿[i]\n<br />[/i][size=3]?️ A Dynamic World - ? Roleplaying - ?
