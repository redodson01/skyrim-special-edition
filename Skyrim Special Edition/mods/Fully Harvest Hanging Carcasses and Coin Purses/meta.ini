nexusDescription="[size=3][b][color=#6d9eeb]Features[/color][/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]&gt; When you harvest hanging dead animal carcasses (rabbits, pheasants, salmons, charred skeevers), they disappear (until the object respawns), instead of continuing to hang as before with no visual changes.\n<br />\n<br />&gt; Fixed that when you take coin purses their collision still remains there, which means that you can still physically interact with it: bump into it, hit it with weapons, shoot arrows at it and the arrows will stick as if the purse was still there, and taking a purse from a pressure plate doesn't release it. Same fix for hanging horker meat in the Skaal Village.\n<br />\n<br />&gt; Fixed, more accurate collision for hanging salmons. First of all for DeadSalmon02 (the darker and smaller one), whose collision starts well below its head so that for example if you shoot arrows at that area they will stick there floating in the air, swinging together with the salmon (see images).[/size] [size=2]Better collision for the hanging horker in the Skaal Village.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[youtube]D71EREBVBvc[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Differences from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28197]Wiseman303's Flora Fixes[/url]:\n<br />[spoiler]You might notice that WM Flora Fixes contains similar features: makes harvested hanging carcasses disappear and fixes coin purses not releasing pressure plates when harvested.\n<br />\n<br />The first feature in WM Flora Fixes works by adding SwitchNode to the meshes. This method suffers from the same issues as vanilla coin purses: the collision of the object still remains there after harvesting. Even though the object visually disappears, you can still physically interact with it: bump into it, hit it with weapons, shoot at it with arrows and the arrows will stick as if it was still there, etc. Arrows shot at it before harvesting will also remain there floating in the air.\n<br />\n<br />Our mod changes meshes in a similar way (using SwitchNode), but also workarounds the mentioned issues via scripts﻿. The scripts disable collision of the object when it's harvested, and also pick up all arrows sticking from the object being harvested so that they don't stay floating in the air.\n<br />\n<br />[size=2][size=2]Our mod also improves collision for hanging salmons. Another little difference is that the nail that the salmon is hanging on doesn't disappear when you harvest the salmon.[/size][/size]\n<br />\n<br />The second feature in WM Flora Fixes works by disabling the object. This method doesn't work with objects that are dynamically enabled/disabled via an Enable Parent (there are 39 such coin purses in the vanilla game). Our mod uses the same scripts as for hanging animals to fix coin purses, which works for objects that are dynamically enabled/disabled.[/spoiler][/size][b]\n<br />[/b][size=2]Differences from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/151806]Immersive Hanging Dead Animal Harvest - OIF[/url]:\n<br />[spoiler]That mod works by disabling the object. This method doesn't work with objects that are dynamically enabled/disabled via an Enable Parent, i.e. it simply won't work for some instances of objects, unlike our mod. Because of that, that mod also has to remake the respawn mechanic so the objects can respawn, while with our mod objects naturally respawn consistently with the rest of the game.\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Our mod also improves collision for hanging salmons. Another little difference is that the nail that the salmon is hanging on doesn't disappear when you harvest the salmon.[/size] And obviously it also fixes coin purses.[/spoiler][/size][b][color=#6d9eeb][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />Requirements\n<br />[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][size=2][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854]powerofthree's Papyrus Extender[/url]﻿[/size]\n<br />[/list][b][color=#6d9eeb][size=3]\n<br />Compatibility[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[size=2][size=2][size=2]\n<br />[/size][/size][/size][list]\n<br />[*][size=2][size=2][size=2]Not compatible with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13186]Flora Respawn Fix[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27781]Brutal Flora Harvest Fix[/url]﻿.
