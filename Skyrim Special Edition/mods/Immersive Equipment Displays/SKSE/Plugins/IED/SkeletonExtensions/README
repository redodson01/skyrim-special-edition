Skeleton extensions allow dynamically creating new gear nodes or converting sheaths to XP32 spec (CME->MOV->Node layout). It can be used to adapt skeletons to work with IED or SDS without actually having the meshes installed or to make new nodes for your presets.

The plugin uses skeleton IDs and signatures to uniquely identify skeleton meshes. To find a skeleton ID, open the mesh in nifskope and look for 'SkeletonID' NiIntegerExtraData. IDs aren't really globally unique, you'll usually want to use signatures - these are FNV-1a hashes generated from various data found on the skeleton (see https://github.com/SlavicPotato/ied-dev/blob/master/ImmersiveEquipmentDisplays/IED/SkeletonID.cpp). To find a skeleton signature, you need to be in-game and have an actor with the skeleton in question loaded, then navigate to Tools->Diagnostics->Skeleton explorer, select the actor and click on the signature text to copy it to clipboard.
