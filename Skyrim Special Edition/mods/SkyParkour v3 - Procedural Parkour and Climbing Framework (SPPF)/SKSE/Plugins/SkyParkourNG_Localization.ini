OnOff = Turn mod ON/OFF
Indicator = Show blue / red indicators when a ledge is available depending on stamina.
PlaybackSpeed = Change the animation playback speed multiplier.

UsePresetKey = Use a key from game control map. Key will match automatically for keyboard / gamepad. Custom key doesn't support this feature.
CustomKey = Change the Custom Parkour Key
Delay = Delay going into parkour mode. Using a non-zero delay with the 'Jump Preset Key' buffers the jump until threshold is passed. Tap to jump, hold to parkour.

StaminaSystem = Parkour actions consume stamina. 'High' & 'Highest' consume full, 'Medium', 'Low', 'Vault', 'Grab' consume half of the stamina damage option. 'Steps' do not consume stamina regardless.
MustHaveStamina = In case of insufficient stamina, 'High' & 'Highest' climbing actions will play a 'Fail' animation instead. Disabling this will turn stamina system into more of a cosmetic feature.
StaminaCost = Base consumption value (x). Formula is x + (Equipment Weight) * 0.2. The more items you equip, the higher the cost is.

SmartSteps = Steps will only work when you're moving. This option doesn't modify the additional 'is player forward velocity low enough?' check.
SmartVault = If not sneaking, 'Vault' will only work when sprinting. If sneaking, 'Vault' will only work when moving.
SmartClimb = 'High' & 'Highest' climb will only work when standing still. This also applies to 'Fail' if 'Must Have Stamina' option is enabled.
