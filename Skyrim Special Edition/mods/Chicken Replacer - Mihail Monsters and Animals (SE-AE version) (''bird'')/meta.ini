Due to the poor quality of the model, a detailed re-texture of it was never possible, so I decided not only to bring a new texture, but also to make a completely new model, adapted to the current Skyrim modding standards.[/size][/i]\n<br />\n<br />[/font][/left][left][i][color=#f4f4f4][font=Times New Roman][size=4][img]https://i.imgur.com/Mn6RuP1.jpg[/img][/size][/font][/color][/i][/left][left][font=Times New Roman][i][size=4]\n<br />This mod not only stays true to the original concept, but makes the chicken's appearance even better embedded in the overall Skyrim setting. [/size][color=#e69138][size=5][u]The mod is completely .esp free[/u][/size][/color][color=#f4f4f4], [size=4]so just install the model and texture, and finally enjoy a high quality avian in your game.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]﻿[/size]\n<br />[/i][img]https://i.imgur.com/XwFuxsS.png[/img][u]\n<br />[/u][size=5][img]https://i.imgur.com/cbCrPLy.jpg[/img]﻿﻿\n<br />- High quality new detailed model, 4k texture and 2k normal map replacer for chickens, \n<br />[/size][color=#f4f4f4][size=4]a creature originally with textures with low resolution of 256 x 256 and a very lowpoly model;[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/ufzoccn.jpg[/img]\n<br />[size=5]﻿[/size][/color][color=#f4f4f4][size=5]- The loadscreen sometimes displayed when traveling to Whiterun and surroundings, showing several chickens around a wooden crate, has also been replaced with a new one using the new models.

I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)\n<br />[/color]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/C3cLO6f.png[/img]﻿\n<br />[size=4]The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/amFA4g0.png[/img][/size]\n<br />[size=5]Author: \n<br />\n<br />Mihail- new model, textures, normal maps, new loadscreen[/size]\n<br />[b]\n<br />[/b][b]\n<br />[/b][u][i][color=#1e84cc][size=3]\n<br />[/size][/color][/i][/u][img]https://i.imgur.com/bFFhLJ6.png[/img]﻿[color=#ff7700][i][size=6]New quest mod coming soon:[/size][size=5] [/size][/i][/color][size=4][i]The mod's first open alpha test release was initially planned for late September but was pushed back to mid-October for better polish. The several hours long adventure takes place mostly in Oblivion, specially on the Deadlands, and is intended for the Champion of Mehrunes Dagon, however, several of the objectives include interaction with other realms and daedra, even in places outside of Oblivion itself: you will travel between dungeons, open areas, underground caves, towns, gigantic daedric towers, and much more.\n<br />In October I will relese the first open alpha for community testing and bug finding, also as a show of respect to the users, since the project will take a full year yet to be completed, and i want people to know that the project is being developed, and also providing them a place to have fun while waiting, and at same time this will help me with bug finding, and with ideas for improvment. Quest has 30 acts, each new alpha will feature 3 new acts. Open Alpha Test 1 will feature only the first 3 acts, but already with several hours of content. I plan to release a total of 9 to 10 alphas before the finished release.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=6][i]Oblivion Gate test[/i][/size]\n<br />[url=https://youtu.be/1iSHwYh6_y0]﻿[youtube]1iSHwYh6_y0[/youtube]\n<br />[/url][size=3][i](First test made on testing cell with vanilla interior dungeon lightning, second test made on vanilla\n<br />dagon shrine with natural exterior world lightning. I was not happy with my first try (showcased on\n<br />the video of the first gate test I published time ago), so i came back and redone the oblivion gate\n<br />effects and sounds, and now i like them much more.)[/i][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][i]Oblivion Gate test 2﻿[/i][/size]\n<br />[youtube]vfPDAtma2yo[/youtube]\n<br />[i](Final test just to see how daedra exiting the gate would look like. No daedra will come from this gate, but[/i]\n<br />[i]later on the mod they will come from others, while already in oblivion, specially when travelling between[/i]\n<br />[i]realms and/or pocket realms. Check the previous testing to see the full working mechanics of the[/i]\n<br />[i]Oblivion Gates on the mod.)[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=6]Mythic Dawn Archvicar lines[/size][/i]\n<br />[youtube]ikOOeNeSXjw[/youtube]\n<br />[i](He is the second main NPC of the mod, with Agent Ragna being the first and the central npc of the introdutory\n<br />quest \"The Sigils of Oblivion\". After finishing it, you start the main one, \"The Herald of the Second Coming\",\n<br />and is the Archivar who introduces you to the adventure. (he is using right now my 4k re-texture of Mythic\n<br />Dawn Robes, but in the finished version he will receive unique \"Mythic Dawn Priest Robes\", although\n<br />they will not be featured yet on the first open alpha testing release))[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][i]Interaction with Dagon at Azrak'ath Ruins[/i][/size]\n<br />[youtube]BNLmUa6npB0[/youtube]\n<br />[i](First communication with Dagon in the end of the introdutory quest \"The Sigils of Oblivion\". After you\n<br />collect the sigil stone you travel to his shrine to enter the gate to the Deadlands. (video is a bit outdated,\n<br />on current state the eyes of dagon glow in fire when you approach and he starts talking))[/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][i]Azrak'ath Ruins boss fight (end of act 1 of 30)[/i][/size]\n<br />[youtube]dNK_1mTOmZI[/youtube]\n<br />[i](Final boss of the Azrak'ath Ruins. These ruins are underground Daedric ruins on Nirn, more specifically on the Reach. Here\n<br />you complete Act 1 of the mod, and most of the remaining 29 acts take place in Oblivion, about 80% of them in the Deadlands.\n<br />In act 1 the introductory quest The Sigils of Oblivion occurs, where you collect the Sigil Stone that will be used to open the Oblivion\n<br />Gate that I showed in previous videos. When you enter the gate the main quest The Herald of the Second Coming will then begin.)\n<br />[/i]\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][i]Azrak'ath Ruins Mythic Dawn ghosts in the end of act 1[/i][/size]\n<br />[youtube]98yCNmHDOgM[/youtube]\n<br />[i][size=3](At the end of Act 1, still on Nirn, in an underground daedric ruin, after you finish the dungeon and acquire the\n<br />ritualistic Sigil Stone, several Mythic Dawn ghosts who were killed in this ruin during the Oblivion Crisis,\n<br />during an attack by Vigilants of Stendarr, appear to motivate you to go ahead and carry out Dagon's plans,\n<br />which start with the Dragonborn opening a portal to Oblivion.)[/size][/i][size=3][b][url=http://en.cdprojektred.com/]\n<br />[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[/b][b]\n<br />[/b][b]\n<br />\n<br />[/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size][u][i][color=#1e84cc][size=3]\n<br />[/size][/color][/i][/u]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/font][/left]"
