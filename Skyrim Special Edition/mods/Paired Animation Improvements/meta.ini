nexusDescription="[img]https://i.imgur.com/bXT9VcN.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿This is a small plugin that I made after learning about issues with paired animations work in Skyrim - namely the fact that adding animation events as annotations inside animation files doesn't seem to work.\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿The plugin in itself doesn't really do anything new - it simply enables animations to do some things they couldn't before.\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿Technical information for those interested:\n<br />   ﻿After reverse engineering quite a lot and figuring out how it all works, it turned out that the annotations are in fact being read by the game - but the game expects a prefix ([b]NPC [/b]or [b]2_[/b]), so it knows which event is supposed to play on which actor. Fair enough... except events [i]with prefixes[/i] are actually supposed to be included in behavior [i]as well[/i]. So events like the dummy [b]PIE[/b] event from [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65089]Payload Interpreter[/url]﻿ would not work, even with a proper prefix ([b]NPCPIE[/b]/[b]2_PIE[/b]), because the event [i]with[/i] the prefix does not exist in the behavior graph.\n<br />   ﻿The whole thing seems unnecessary as the game does in fact convert the prefixed events to the non-prefixed ones anyway. The prefixed ones just had to exist to be recognized.\n<br />   ﻿The plugin simplifies all that by removing the need for the prefixed events to exist in behavior graphs. It strips the prefix right away while it's being read.\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿The plugin, as a sort of a side effect, also stops the synchronized clip bindings from being pre-created when the behavior graph is loaded by the game, reverting to an actually fully implemented (and unused?) vanilla feature that creates a binding on demand. This frees up a few hundred animation slots that can now be used by animation replacers.\n<br />\n<br />[center][url=https://ko-fi.com/ershin][img]https://github.com/doodlum/nexusmods-widgets/blob/main/Ko-fi_40px_60fps.png?raw=true[/img][/url]  [url=https://patreon.com/Ershin][img]https://github.com/doodlum/nexusmods-widgets/blob/main/Patreon_40px.png?raw=true[/img][/url][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/nMXe3Mz.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Animation events included as annotations in paired animations are now recognized by the game\n<br />[*]Synchronized clip bindings are no longer pre-created by the game on launch, taking up valuable space that could be used by animation replacers.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />It's okay if you don't have any idea what that means :) The plugin is just going to enable animators to do some things they couldn't before.\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/gvKSmdx.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444]Address Library for SKSE Plugins[/url]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />Use your mod manager of choice.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/TAtofXI.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Should be compatible with any non-ancient Skyrim version, including 1.5.97, 1.6+ and VR.\n<br />[*]﻿[b]Incompatible[/b] with Open Animation Replacer older than v2.0.0.\n<br />[*][b]Compatible[/b] with Open Animation Replacer v2.0.0+.\n<br />[*][b]Compatible[/b] with Dynamic Animation Replacer...\n<br />...and all other known mods.[/list]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/6eAesuT.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][color=#a4c2f4][b]Legendary Edition version?[/b][/color]\n<br />[/list]   ﻿I'm sorry, but no. Special Edition's engine is much more stable and frameworks like CommonLibSSE allow much easier implementation of advanced plugins. It's [b]really, really[/b] time to move on. However, feel free to try porting the mod to LE if you're up to the challenge. I'd rather spend my time on something else than supporting a much worse and, at this point, absurdly outdated version of the game.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][color=#a4c2f4][b]Is it compatible with [SE/AE/VR]?[/b][/color]\n<br />[/list]   Yes.\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][color=#a4c2f4][b]Can I install/uninstall this in the middle of a playthrough?[/b][/color]\n<br />[/list]   Yes. The plugin has no lasting impact on your game and can be installed/uninstalled anytime.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/fogKA0r.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿The annotations in paired animations need to be set up in a specific way to be recognized by the game. As I'm not an animator, I've asked [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3127912]NickNak[/url] to write up a short instruction. He has prepared more than I expected! An archive containing a pdf with instructions, some examples and vanilla killmove events is available in miscellaneous files.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/OIXIccV.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />   [url=https://github.com/ersh1/PairedAnimationImprovements]GitHub[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/cgEcXac.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[b]My patrons for the support!❤️[/b]\n<br />\n<br />The SKSE Team for SKSE.\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5687342]﻿Ryan[/url] for the invaluable [url=https://github.com/Ryan-rsm-McKenzie/CommonLibSSE]CommonLibSSE[/url].\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2148728]powerofthree[/url] for the [url=https://github.com/powerof3/CommonLibSSE]CommonLibSSE fork[/url].\n<br />[url=https://github.com/CharmedBaryon/]CharmedBaryon[/url] for [url=https://github.com/CharmedBaryon/CommonLibSSE-NG/]CommonLibSSE-NG[/url].\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2964753]meh321[/url] for the Address Library.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3127912]NickNak[/url] for providing many iterations of test animations and helping me figure out the whole thing, and writing up the information about paired animations.\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/95120793]alandse[/url] for licensing help.\n<br />All the Skyrim reverse engineers who share their work, as well as everyone who share the source to their SKSE plugins.
