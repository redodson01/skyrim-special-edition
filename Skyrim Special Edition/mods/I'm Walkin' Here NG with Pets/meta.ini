nexusDescription="[font=Times New Roman][color=#ffd966][size=6]Features[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />\n<br />This is an edit of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77394]I'm walkin' here NG[/url] version 1.7 by [url=https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/VersuchDrei/about-me?gameId=1704]VersuchDrei[/url], which is an edit of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27742]I'm Walkin' Here[/url] by [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5687342]Fudgyduff[/url], which is the SE implementation of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79327]Don't Push Me While I'm Talking[/url] for LE by Utopium.\n<br />If you are not familiar with any of these mods, basically they disable collisions between player and player's allies (marked as teammates)/player's summons/allies' (marked as teammates) summons or during dialogues.\n<br />\n<br />This particular edit enables pets from [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Pets_of_Skyrim]CC Pets[/url]﻿ (or any actor that is in the PetFramework_PetFaction faction) for the feature described above without having to mark them as teammates (which would make them a valid target for player enemies).\n<br />\n<br />While working on this, I also discovered and fixed a bizarre bug that is present in I'm walkin' here NG﻿ 1.7 (not sure about the original mod) which makes the configuration file that comes with the mod purely cosmetic.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Times New Roman][color=#ffd966][size=6]Installation[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />\n<br />Can be installed or uninstalled mid-playthrough without any problem and does not contain any ESP files.\n<br />\n<br />[list=1]\n<br />[*]Install the latest [url=https://skse.silverlock.org/]Skyrim Script Extender[/url]﻿ for your version of the game.\n<br />[*]Install the latest [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444?tab=files]Address Library for SKSE Plugins[/url]﻿ for your version of the game.\n<br />[*]Install this mod like any other using your mod manager.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />The mod also comes with the configuration file, options of which are pretty much self-explanatory.\n<br />\n<br />[font=Times New Roman][color=#ffd966][size=6]Known Issues and Limitations[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />\n<br />While disabled, there are still small remnants of collisions, which do make movement jittery while being \"in\" the collideable actor. This is a problem of the original implementation and doesn't bother me enough to try to find some workaround. Some may even like it as it adds some rigidness to actors."
