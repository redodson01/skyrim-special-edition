Both of those mentioned mods' seasons systems are included in one place.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Features[/size][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Dynamically altered Globals based on month that can be attached to weathers in Region records through a patch.\n<br />[*]MCM interface for customizing weather chances for each month.\n<br />[*]Seasonal Imagespaces - change image colors depending on season, such as colder colors during winter. (Not compatible with most ENBs)\n<br />[*]A simple Load/Save settings so you don't have to adjust again upon New Game.

Install Seasonal Weathers Framework\n<br />  2. Install a weather mod of your choice (See Patches available section to see what weather mods are covered)\n<br />  3. Install the patch for the weather mod you chose (see available patches in Files section)\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=5][b]Patches available[/b][/size][/center]     [b][i]Warning, the patches may be outdated[/i][/b]. I hope that others make the patches and maintain them themselves as I can't keep track of them all the time.\n<br />Patches are available for the following weathers mods:\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][b]Vanilla weathers[/b] (you can use this version to add seasonal weathers support to any weathers mod, as long as you understand you lose new custom weathers provided by mods, just put the patch after the weather mod) \n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24791]Cathedral Weathers and Seasons[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2237]Climates Of Tamriel[/url]﻿\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28920]Kyne's Weathers And Seasons[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11578]Mythical Ages[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12842]NAT - Natural and Atmospheric Tamriel[/url]﻿\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27141]NAT.ENB III - Natural and Atmospheric Tamriel ENB 3.0[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38655?tab=files]NLA[/url] by kojak747\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77191/?]NLA - Natural Lighting and Atmospherics for ENB SE[/url] by L00﻿\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12125]Obsidian Weathers and Seasons[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32364]Picturesque[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63116]RAID Weathers[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8398]Rustic Weathers and Lighting[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49004]SOLAS Weathers and ENB[/url]\n<br />[*]﻿[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2472]True Storms SE[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2187]Vivid Weathers[/url] (make sure you don't have Winter/Summer seasons optionals installed from Vivid Weathers installer)\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24439]Wander - A Weather Mod[/url]\n<br />[/list][b]\n<br />Vanilla version[/b] works for the following weathers mods:\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42731]Azurite Weathers[/url] \n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7895?]Dolomite Weathers[/url]\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36227]Onyx - VR Weathers[/url]﻿\n<br />[*][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55005?]Weathers For ENB[/url]﻿﻿\n<br />[/list]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=5][center]Compatibility[/center][/size][/b]     Seasonal Weathers Framework itself doesn't touch any vanilla records and doesn't conflict with anything.\n<br />\n<br />     However, the patches available here made for weathers mods will have incompatibilities with other mods like [b]Sounds of Skyrim[/b] and [b]Audio Overhaul for Skyrim[/b]. They are incompatible because those mods also change the Region records that weathers mods use.\n<br />\n<br />     So, if you already use patches between weathers mods and mods like [b]Sounds of Skyrim[/b] and [b]Audio Overhaul for Skyrim[/b], you will have to edit them to include [b]Seasonal Weathers Framework[/b] as well.\n<br />\n<br />     Please do not ask me for patches regarding other mods that aren't weathers mods. I leave this part to the rest of modding community.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b][color=#ffe599]The following part is for those who want to make patch for weather mods to work with Seasonal Weathers Framework.[/color][/b]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />\n<br />When you make a patch, you need to add the Globals provided by Seasonal Weather Framework that start with [b]Season_[/b] (for non-snowy regions) or [b]SN_Season_[/b] (for snowy regions) to each weather in the Region records.\n<br />[url=https://i.imgur.com/DcouBmL.png]Example Screenshot\n<br />[/url]\n<br />Most weather mods don't have snow weathers in non-snowy regions so you will need to manually add them to the Regions records and then assign them a Global. Same thing for snowy regions and rain weathers.\n<br />\n<br />You can use the following [b]Globals[/b] when adding them to the weathers in Region records:\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]For non-snowy regions[/u][/b]:\n<br />\n<br />Use the [b]Common [/b]set of Globals if you need the more simple seasons system similar to Obsidian Weathers, these Globals are used all seasons, but their values are changed based on month.\n<br />\n<br />Season_Common_Overcast\n<br />Season_Common_Pleasant\n<br />Season_Common_PleasantA\n<br />Season_Common_Rain\n<br />Season_Common_Rain_Storm\n<br />Season_Common_Snow\n<br />Season_Common_Snow_Storm\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ea9999]The following Globals are for weathers you want to play only during that season in non-snowy regions. A system similar to Aequinoctium's seasons system where if you assign the weather a Spring Global, the weather will only play during Spring.
