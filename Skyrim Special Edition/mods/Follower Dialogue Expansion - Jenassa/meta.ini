There are no questions, no grey areas.\"[/size][/color][/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c9daf8][size=4][b]How is Jenassa envisioned and touched on in this mod (MAIN VERSION):[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />In this mod, Jenassa is expanded as a [b][color=#ffff00]seasoned mercenary whose life has been shaped by betrayal, loss, and exploitation. [/color][/b]The shadows of her past have turned her into a [b][color=#ffff00]cynical, cold killer with a morally grey worldview. [/color][/b]She will fight for you for a price - as her professionalism demands.\n<br />\n<br />Jenassa's story begins with the brutal onslaught of the An-Xileel of Black Marsh, who raided her village and left her to survive on her own. A series of events eventually led her to Windhelm, where she met the artist she loved. From her, Jenassa learned to appreciate the beauty of life - but the prejudice of the Nords in Windhelm took Jenassa's lover from her. Driven by grief, Jenassa sought revenge and was imprisoned for her actions.\n<br />\n<br />She was later freed, not by a benevolent savior, but by Imperial oligarchs who saw her as a tool to eliminate their enemies. Bound by their orders, Jenassa found herself trapped in a cycle of violence, [b][color=#ffff00]her trust in kindness shattered along with her dreams of freedom.[/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Jenassa follows you out of contractual obligations, but will she ever come to respect you as a leader? [b][color=#ffff00]Can you help her make peace with her past and learn to trust again?[/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />You can hire her for 500 gold in Whiterun. As a follower, Jenassa is a skilled swordswoman and archer, capable of dealing significant damage to your enemies when equipped properly.\n<br />\n<br />In the mod, Jenassa has a [b][color=#ffff00]cold, cynical demeanor,[/color][/b] but beneath her hardened exterior lies an appreciation for art and poetic expressions. For Jenassa, [b][color=#ffff00]rewards justify the journey, and she expects the same from you.\n<br />[/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />---\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c9daf8][b]Features:[/b][/color]\n<br />1.

What's with the main version and the Dark Brotherhood version?\n<br />In the original FDE Jenassa, Jenassa was written to be a Dark Brotherhood assassin.\n<br />Since 3.0, her personality was rewritten per Patron request to be a more grounded version based on her vanilla lines.\n<br />The new version has significantly more content than the original Dark Brotherhood version.\n<br />\n<br />8. How do I revert her to the Dark Brotherhood personality?\n<br />Install the DB patch or\n<br />Type the following console commands:\n<br />set aaJenassaDBEnabled to 1\n<br />(click Jenassa)\n<br />addtofaction IvarsteadKlimmekFaction\n<br />\n<br />9.
