nexusDescription="[size=4][b][color=yellow]With the release of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136793]Widescreen Scale Removed[/url]﻿, my Squish Fixes are now obsolete.  What is still needed, though, are Difficulty Persistence Fixes, which I patched for DDDM (warm), DDDM (white), and DD Paper.  Install [size=4][b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136793]Widescreen Scale Removed[/url]﻿[/b][/size], grab the persistence fix you need in my downloads, and don't let anything overwrite.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[/b][/size]If you've been linked here for the Hero Menu unsquish fix for Enderal, you can go get it here:  [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/enderalspecialedition/mods/931]Dear Diary - Hero Menu Unsquished for Enderal[/url]﻿\n<br />[size=4][b]\n<br />[/b][/size][size=3][b]=============== old description below [b]===============[/b][/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />I love [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1863120]uranreactor[/url]'s [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60837]Dear Diary Dark Mode[/url].  When the recent update (1.6.1130) squishified some of the UI, I shopped around a bit for a replacement, but couldn't find one that suited me.  So, I decided to try and fix my favourite UI instead.\n<br />\n<br />First off, this is all really uranreactor's work.  They've done a fantastic job, so credit to them.  All I did was decompile some affected files, made some tweaks, and resaved.  If/when uranreactor updates their release, this page will go bye bye.\n<br />\n<br />Starting with 0.7, the game difficulty setting fix [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379]mentioned here [/url]﻿was added to the DD files here.  Credit to SKSE Team and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2166624]ianpatt[/url] for posting the info.  If you do not use a DD mod, and your quest_journal.swf is just the SkyUI one (so not overwritten), you'll want to use [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106418]SkyUI SE - Difficulty Persistence Fix[/url] instead of any file here.\n<br />\n<br />Note:\n<br />- These fixes will only work for 1.6.1130+ users, but there'd be no reason to use it on an older version, anyway.\n<br />- Editing UI files is new territory for me, but I think I got it.  Let me know if something doesn't look right.  No promises, but I'll try and fix!\n<br />- Let me know if I missed a piece of the UI (please be specific if reporting: how to invoke it and provide a screen shot if possible).\n<br />- I play using a 16:9 aspect ratio and the included files should be fine if you do, too.  I've heard some of my files work with widescreen, but not all.  [s]I have no plans on supporting other aspect ratios.[/s][b] I've started looking into this.[/b]\n<br />- Currently supporting [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60837]Dear Diary Dark Mode warm/white[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23010]Dear Diary Paper[/url].\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]On the \"Difficulty Persistence Fix\":[/b]\n<br />\n<br />I've read a couple isolated posts saying the original 'difficulty persistence fix' (for the quest_journal.swf), which I integrated in version 0.7,  only works on 1.6.1130.  [b]T[/b][b]hese claims are false[/b].  I've done some pretty extensive testing with saves/autosaves/reloading, including a lot of testing with the survival option, and have had zero issues using it on 1.6.1170.  (Note:  My testing was done with, of course, DDDM and my fixes here.  Perhaps there's something about DDDM that makes it continue to work - I don't know.  I just know that it does.)\n<br />\n<br />Using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75188]Untarnished UI[/url]?  You'll instead want to go here [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107604]Untarnished UI 1.1.6 - Unsquished Fix[/url] and then here [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112659]Untarnished UI - Unsquished Fix - More Fixes[/url].  If you use C.O.C.K.S., you'll also want to drop by here [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112913]Untarnished UI - Unsquished Fix - Constructible Object Custom Keyword System[/url]﻿."
