He is skilled in one-handed and archery. He has a preference for light armour. He will not trigger most traps. If you’re sneaking he won’t chatter. If you talk to him while sneaking he’ll whisper. He can talk to various npcs, and he will develop slightly differently for each player based on choices you make during your time together.\n<br />[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />[center]\n<br />[youtube]YMNN_WGcvFQ[/youtube][youtube]24AJ4gEQtFs[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />[b][font=Arial][color=#ffffff][size=3]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/size][/color][/font][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][b][color=#ffd966][size=4]The INIGO Discord[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=3][b]The permanent invite link is: [url=https://discord.gg/FATJtQXrw9]https://discord.gg/FATJtQXrw9[/url]﻿[/b]\n<br />[size=1]\n<br />[/size][i]We now have a bot on the Inigo server called \"Inigo BOT\".\n<br />He will respond to your \"!anythoughts\" command (without the quotes) with one of his many responses.[/i][/size][/color][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[b][font=Arial][color=#ffffff][size=3]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/size][/color][/font][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][b][color=#ffd966][size=4]INIGO Facebook Page![/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=3]WolfKitty has started a facebook group, [size=4][url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/InigoFans/]Friends of Inigo[/url][/size].

He's next to Sibbi Black-Briar in the first cell on your left. Keep an eye out for notes referring to Inigo on your travels. If your character needs a reason to visit the jail they may give you the excuse you require. Inigo is technically not a prisoner. You don't have to pick the lock to his cell.

His combat stats are not that high, but he does have a lot of health and stamina. He also has a few combat perks that give him an edge in battle. If you think he's overpowered, try swapping his weapons for lower end equipment before attempting to alter him in the Creation Kit.\n<br />\n<br />Remember, your game's difficulty setting determines how powerful everyone is. If you're playing on a higher difficulty Inigo (and everyone else) will do more damage.[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][color=#6fa8dc][size=4]About your aggression...[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]You can ask Inigo to be aggressive or unaggressive. This setting will largely determine when he chooses to fight. You can set his aggression using this topic or by whistling (see the whistling section below for more detail).[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Fight whenever you like.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]Inigo is aggressive by default. In this state he will attack enemies on sight and he won't leave a battle until it is over. He is more likely to break cover and attack in this mode, but he's also more likely to save you from an attack you didn't see coming.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Try to only fight when it's necessary.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]When set to unaggressive Inigo is far less likely to break cover while sneaking. You can also lead him away from combat. These behaviors are handled by a number of procedures that override his combat in certain situations.        \n<br />\n<br />When you are sneaking and an enemy is searching for you near by, Inigo will stand and bare his teeth instead of launching an attack. He will not fight unless your party has been spotted or hurt.\n<br />\n<br />If you are sneaking and he breaks cover while set to unaggressive someone in your party was spotted or attacked. Remember that while Inigo's sneak skill is high, you're both more visible at lower levels. Armor enchanted with Fortify Sneak or Muffle can make a big difference.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]A note on aggression and weapon states[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]Sheathe your weapon during combat while Inigo is unaggressive and he will usually stop fighting and run to your position.\n<br />\n<br />When Inigo is set to unaggressive and you are both at full health Inigo will never engage an enemy while your weapon is away. He will continue to follow you instead of fighting.\n<br />\n<br />When your weapon is sheathed and Inigo's health is between 40% and 99% he will still follow you in combat, but if you stop moving while the fight is going on he will defend your position. If his health falls below 40% he will always stop following and defend himself. If you see Inigo attempt to engage then draw back repeatedly chances are you have your weapon away and he is unaggressive. Draw your weapon to let him off his leash... as it were.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]About your fighting style...[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]Inigo is skilled in one handed and archery. He performs equally well in either heavy or light armor. He does not use magic. You can ask him to use one of three custom fighting styles...\n<br />\n<br />Ranged– Inigo will favour the bow and try to keep some distance between himself and the enemy. \n<br />\n<br />Close– Inigo will favour melee weapons and engage enemies face to face when possible.\n<br />\n<br />Mixed (default) – Inigo will use both ranged and close attacks. \n<br />\n<br />Inigo will occasionally override his ranged and close fighting styles to get the job done if necessary.\n<br />\n<br />When you ask him to be unaggressive he won't attack things on sight any more, but he will still jump into combat if either you or he have been spotted by an attacker. Your sneak level/buffs will largely determine when this happens.[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][color=#ffd966][size=5]Relaxing[/size][/color]\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]Inigo can relax in almost any safe area. When he's relaxing he'll use any available idle markers and furniture near by, unless they are owned by someone else. He will relax indefinitely.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=5]Talking[/size][/color]\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]Inigo's random chatter does not fire at pre-determined intervals. It's entirely conditioned based. He may be chatty one day then quieter the next. He has thousands of lines, many of which relate to choices you make during your time together. Others are determined by skill, quest progress, gender, race, current level and various other factors.\n<br />\n<br />You can never hear everything, but much of what you do hear will be tailored to you.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Could we have less idle chitchat, please?[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]This lowers the number of idle chatter lines available. He will be less chatty, but he will still randomly talk from time to time. Have him wear the Necklace of Muffletongue (found in his cell) to shut him up completely. Ingio is more likely to talk when he is near you and many of his travelling lines won't fire outside of the main Skyrim worldspace.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]I'd rather you didn't talk to other people while we are adventuring together.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]When this has been selected Inigo won't trigger conversations with other characters unless they are important to his story. Conversations added by other companion mods, such as Vilja and Lucien, are unaffected by this option.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]About scenes with NPCs[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]Inigo is more likely to talk to you other companions when you are travelling across Skyrim, but certain scenes can occur in inns and player homes too. Your other companion must be actively following you for these scenes to fire. Currently Inigo has scenes with Lydia, J'zargo, Mjoll, Erik, Kharjo, Meeko, Vigilance... and a number of other random NPCs who are not followers.  (For interactions with custom followers Lucien, Vilja, Auri, and others see links under 'Interactions With Others' further up the page.)[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]If Inigo isn't talking to someone he should be...[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]First make sure you've read the paragraph above. If a character alias has been cleared by another mod or some such, you can refresh the aliases by selecting \"Think about the people you'd like to talk to. Maybe you're forgetting someone?\" found in the talking topic. This will re-add npcs that lost their address (as it were).[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Try to fight quietly when I'm sneaking (on by default)[/size][/color].\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]In this mode Inigo will try to keep his mouth shut during combat if you are being stealthy. He will still comment when a fight is over, but he will do it quietly. Quest related combat lines are not muted by this option. If you hear him say something while fighting in this mode it probably moved a quest stage forward somewhere.[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][color=#ffd966][size=5]Follow distance[/size][/color]\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]By default Inigo follows you closely - at around 256 units. This is in line with the minimum distance used by vanilla companions. You can ask him to follow further behind - at around 390 units. At this distance he is less likely to bump into you, but he may have a harder time keeping up. Inigo moves faster than vanilla companions. If he's lagging behind your group check his follow distance.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=5]Horses[/size][/color]\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]You can gift Inigo any vanilla horse you own. You may be able to give him certain horses added by other mods but it is suggested you choose a steed from the main game. Inigo will name his horse and has unique dialogue for every official breed. He also recognizes Frost and Shadowmere.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]I want to give you a horse, Inigo.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]The option to gift a horse will appear when you are standing near a horse you own under \"Mind if I ask you something?\". You can trade steeds with Inigo if you'd rather swap. This option will appear when you are standing near the horse you intend to give him. You can tell Inigo to disown his current horse completely at any time. You don't need to be near his steed for this option to appear.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Can't give Inigo a horse?[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]You need to own the steed you want to give Inigo. If you cheat and spawn a horse he won't recognize it. \n<br />\n<br />Target the horse, open the console, click on it and type:[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=2]setownership[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]Then hit enter, exit the console, and try gifting Inigo the steed again.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]You ride I'll walk./Let's continue on foot.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]You can ask Inigo to ride while you walk. This option appears at the bottom of the main topic window if he's not already riding alone. If he is riding while you walk, the option to continue on foot appears at the bottom of the main topic window. You can also toggle this behaviour by using the activate key on Inigo's horse when your weapon is unequipped.\n<br />\n<br />When Inigo has been asked to ride alone he will dismount if there's trouble or if you start sneaking. He will mount back up once you are standing safe with your weapon away. If he doesn't mount up again fast enough, re-equip then unequip your weapon to get his attention.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Setting Inigo's steed to follow or wait.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]You can set Inigo's steed to follow him at distance or to stay put. Toggle this option by [i]using the activate key[/i] on Inigo's horse when your weapon is equipped. A message at the top left side of your screen will let you know if Inigo's steed is following him or not.\n<br />\n<br />Occasionally you may notice Inigo briefly stand on the back of his horse while dismounting. This is a not a bug, it is a reliable way for the system to get him down in a hurry in certain situations.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Horses and combat.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]When Inigo is riding and your weapon is sheathed he will try to ignore combat. If you draw your weapon he will dismount. His steed will run to a safe distance until the fight is over, or until Inigo has escaped the battle if you choose to flee. What Inigo does after dismounting depends on your weapon state and his aggression (see the combat/aggression section of the Inigo User Guide video for more info).\n<br />[b]\n<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<br />To set if Inigo can ride in your current location open the console and type:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />setpqvInigoStatus Steed Allow     \n<br />\n<br />OR\n<br />\n<br />setpqv InigoStatus Steed Forbid \n<br />[b]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b][/size][/color][/font]\n<br />[font=Arial]\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=5]Mini quest (activation and length)[/size][/color]\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]Select 'Tell me more about your past.' to learn about Inigo's journey so far. You can listen to his story in one go or a little at a time. It won't repeat until it's finished. Once his tale is told, it will disappear from the topic window unless you are seated somewhere safe with Inigo. If you've heard about Inigo's past and discovered his brother's name a short quest can begin at random while you're adventuring across Skyrim. \n<br />\n<br />Currently this mini quest is as far as his story goes. It is an introduction to future events and ends when you receive a certain spell. Finish the quest if you want to get the most out of Inigo. Completing it unlocks a lot of additional content and the reward is very useful. Inigo's quest will continue and end in V3.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=5]Map marker[/size][/color]\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]Inigo has his own map marker. It can be activated shortly after you meet him. The first time you talk to Inigo in the main Skyrim worldspace he will add the marker to your map. You can turn it off and on using your journal.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=5]Whistling[/size][/color]\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]Whistling allows you to quickly communicate with Inigo using a single button. It can be used to control his aggression, break up fights, move him out of your way, signal that it's time to go if he is waiting or relaxing, and much much more. Read the book he gives you \"The Power of Whistling\" for full instructions... or the notes below.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]How do I whistle to Inigo?[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]A short time after you have given your opinion on his map marker Inigo will give you a book about whistling. You will also gain a new power called Whistle to Inigo. The book outlines a few ways whistling can be used to quickly communicate. The power lets you whistle.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Asking Inigo to follow[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]Whistle when Inigo is either waiting or relaxing and he will rejoin you. This works at almost any distance.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Altering Inigo's aggression[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]Whistling with your weapon equipped will set Inigo to aggressive. Whistling with your weapon away will set him to unaggressive. If Inigo is participating in a battle, whistling will always set him to unaggressive whether your weapon is sheathed or not. How he behaves in combat while unaggressive depends on your weapon state (see the aggression section above for more info).[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Stopping accidental fights[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]Whistling when Inigo is in a fight briefly interrupts his combat and makes him re-evaluate the situation. This is a useful way to break up accidental scraps between Inigo and other members of your party. If he is still being attacked he will defend himself for as long as your weapon state allows it.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Asking Inigo to move[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]If you are close to Inigo when you whistle he will try to give you some space. This behaviour is only valid when Inigo is not in a scene, he is following you, and your weapon state matches his aggression.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Getting Inigo's attention[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]Sometimes followers stand still for a while after a fight or conversation. Whistling refreshes Inigo's AI and gets him moving again immediately.\n<br />\n<br />If a companion is stuck in an area with bad/absent nav mesh they may be unable to follow you. Crouching then standing again, or simply walking away, will\n<br />often free them. If all else fails fast travel or wait an hour to unstick them.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Asking Inigo to enter command mode, wait, or relax.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]You can get Inigo into command mode by whistling while looking down at the ground. Once he's in command mode use the 'use' key as usual to issue your request. To ask Inigo to wait or relax simply look at him and whistle when you are within speaking distance. In safe areas you can toggle between waiting and relaxing by repeating the whistle. In homes and inns he will default to relax mode first.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Inigo's whistle response[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]If Inigo responds to your whistle with silence, a whistle of his own, or a random comment, he is following and his aggression already matches your current weapon state.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc][size=4]Some things to remember about whistling[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]In most cases Inigo is controlled by your whistle NOT by his response. Usually he will acknowledge a command vocally, but not always. Don't worry, he probably got the message.\n<br />\n<br />Inigo will never vocally respond to your whistle when he is in a scene. Scenes control conversations with other NPCs, songs, and Inigo's behaviour during small sections of his quest.\n<br />\n<br />One whistle can issue multiple commands. For example, if you signal him to follow and your weapon state has changed since your last whistle, he will alter his aggression AND start following.\n<br />\n<br />Whistling is classed as a power so you can't use it while riding or sitting. This is not a bug.[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=5]Asking Inigo to sit/Quickly controlling followers[/size][/color]\n<br />[color=#ffffff][size=2]You can quickly control any follower by targeting them and holding down your use key (default E). This instantly puts them into command mode. Press your back key (default Tab/Esc) to exit command mode.\n<br />\n<br />Many of Inigo's conversations can only occur when you are both seated. You can use the standard “I need you to do something.” dialogue option to ask him to sit, but this method is a lot faster. Give your follower a moment to accomplish their goal before hitting Tab/Esc. If you exit command mode before they have completed their task they will cancel their objective.[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />[center]\n<br />[line]\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]PL5M3I4Hl78[/youtube][youtube]Mf4AWJA7SVw[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://i.imgur.com/hXQSy.png[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][color=#6fa8dc]Endorsements from the Press[/color][/size][/center]\n<br />[color=#f4f4f4][i]\"I think Inigo is definitely the best follower we have ever showcased on Top 5 Skyrim Mods.\"[/i] -[/color]  [color=#40e0d0]Gamespot[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f4f4f4][i]\"Grab him if you want a partner like no other.\"[/i] -[/color] [color=#40e0d0]IGN[/color] \n<br />\n<br />[color=#f4f4f4][i]\"Inigo is a fantastic follower mod that we definitely recommend.

It covers most of his options and features with visual examples and contains a lot of useful info about various aspects of the mod. It's relevant for any version after V2 no matter what platform you happen to be using.\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Read the book Inigo gives you shortly after leaving Riften – The Power of Whistling. The whistle ability lets you control him in a number of useful ways. It's not a teleport, but it does refresh his AI, move him out of your way, change his aggression, stop friendly fights, ask him to follow, wait, and relax, and can be used to instantly put him into command mode. See the User Guide Video for examples, but read the book too. It explains features not covered in the video and understanding how his whistle power works will give you a tactical edge in a variety of situations.\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Take a break with Inigo every now and then. Inigo has many conversations and lines that will only fire when you are both seated in a safe area (certain conversations will only appear in certain types of locations: player homes, inns, etc). Direct Inigo to a chair near another chair, wait for his sitting animation to complete, then join him. You can do this in a number of ways – You can whistle (read The Power of Whistling for details), you can command him through the “I need you to do something.” dialogue option, or you can ask him to relax (using the whistle or the dialogue option found under “Mind if I ask you something?”) and sit near wherever he decides to sit. Followers tend to have trouble with bench/table combinations, often standing as soon as you use them, so stick to chairs, normal benches, and stools.\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Ask Inigo his thoughts. Inigo has almost a thousand possible thoughts so it's worth clicking the “Any thoughts?” option every now and then, especially if you're relaxing somewhere safe together or in the middle of an interesting area, quest, or situation. If his thoughts seem to dry up don't worry. They are individually conditioned based on what you've done, what you're doing, and what's going on. Asking again later will yield more results.\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Pay attention. The more you pay attention and interact with Inigo based on what you observe the more content you'll unlock. Personally I don't like relationship systems. Instead Inigo develops using a number of hidden quests which record certain things you do, places you visit, dialogue choices you make, etc. These records don't add up to any kind of relationship value you can monitor, instead they alter his future responses to relevant situations. There's no wrong or right way to deal with this system, but the more you interact with Inigo the more lines you unlock based on the choices you've made. He's formed by the memories you make together.\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[*][size=2]Don't forget about Mr Dragonfly. Inigo is very attached to the little guy and putting him in Inigo's inventory will unlock hundreds of new potential lines. If you want to learn how Inigo met Mr D sit and talk with him in a player home once you've settled the matter of your shared past.[/size]\n<br />[/list]\n<br />[size=2][color=#f4f4f4][center]................................................................................................................................................[/center][/color][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=5][color=#ffd966]Where is Inigo heading?[/color][/size][/center]\n<br />[font=Arial][size=2]First of all a massive thank you to everyone who’s been playing with Inigo. I’m so glad that he’s found such an appreciative, supportive, and may I say good looking audience here on the Nexus. I’d love to work on Inigo 24/7 but unfortunately free time is currently an issue. That said I will be adding to Inigo whenever I get the chance. Hopefully this is just the beginning. I thought I’d quickly outline my plans for Inigo.[/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[size=2][*]There's a substantial adventure completely planned out for Inigo. Completing the series of quests that make up his story is my number one priority (V3).\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=2][*]Once that's done I'll maybe consider adding DLC relevant lines for Dragonborn and Dawnguard.\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=2][*]There are never a shortage of ideas, only the time to implement them, so with every future update I'll always add a bit more dialogue - more thoughts, idles, reactions, combat chatter, etc.\n<br />[/size][/list]\n<br />[size=2]Thanks again to everyone out there who is adventuring with Inigo. Be well and take good care of Mr Dragonfly.\n<br />\n<br />Gary[/size][/font]\n<br />[line]\n<br />\n<br />[center][color=#ff7700][b][size=6]FAQ---------FAQ---------FAQ---------FAQ---------FAQ[/size][/b]\n<br />[size=5]↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓[/size][/color][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[font=Arial][color=#ffd966][size=4]When is V3 coming out?[/size][/color]\n<br />[size=2]When it's good and ready. There's simply no way I can predict when such a massive undertaking will be complete. I'm spending all the time I can afford to on Inigo and his quest will be done when it's done... even if I'm the only one still playing Skyrim by the time it's finished. :)[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]If you're interested in seeing a little of what I've been up to with V3 check out the[/size][/b] [url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpWeOeSekPy3sXjTcynWn1pfUTcZ4pf_C][size=3]Making Inigo V3 playlist[/size][/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#ffd966]Inigo's quest isn't progressing after I received the spell.[/color][/size]\n<br />[size=2]Currently his mini quest (Bad Vibrations) is as far as his story goes. It is an introduction to future events and ends when you receive a certain spell. Inigo's quest will continue and end in V3. Make sure you sit somewhere safe with Inigo and have a chat once Bad Vibrations is complete. There's a little more to take care of. I also suggest you revisit L's cabin from time to time. There's a lot more content there than you may realize at first.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#ffd966]Inigo's still ill after visiting a temple, he didn't heal himself (post Peryite)[/color][/size]\n<br />[size=2]First make sure you are giving him a chance to heal himself. Upon entering a temple don't talk to him. If all is well he'll tell you he's going to try to heal himself, then proceed to do so. The vast majority of problems are caused by the player interrupting the scene which allows him to heal so let him do his thing. \n<br />If all else fails you can use the console commands \"prid xx0e7e0d\" and  \"disable\" to cure him.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#ffd966]Touring Carriages Problems...[/color][/size]\n<br />[size=2]There seems to be an issue with Touring Carriages and off-vanilla followers like Inigo. To be safe have him wait before taking the trip then whistle or summon him once it's over. If it's too late and Inigo has been captured by TC already then retake the journey that broke him, then cancel out of it once you're on the cart. This should free him up. If you're not sure what journey broke him then open the console, click on Inigo, type sv, then hit enter. You'll get a list of all the aliases assigned to Inigo. The TC quest causing the problem will be there in the list and may give you an idea of which journey to re-take (use page up/down to see the full list). Resetting the quest using the command - resetquest EnterTheTourCartquestHere  - may also work.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#ffd966]Inigo draws his bow but does not fire it[/color][/size]\n<br />[size=2]There have been various reports of [b]Visible Favourited Gear[/b] causing this issue with companions. From the VFG posts page -\n<br />\n<br />\"If you unequip and then re-equip Inigo's weapons, the problem goes away UNTIL he switches weapons during combat. After that, the bug \n<br />persists. If you uninstall the mod (VFG), load your save, unequip Inigo of his weapons, dismiss, then have him follow you again and equip him, \n<br />the problem does not persist. He behaves normally and is only ever seen having only one weapon equipped.\"\n<br />\n<br />Another post, this time from the mod author - \n<br />\n<br />\"Indeed it's a bug with in-game setting, so I don't think there is much can be done here.\"\n<br />It's not Inigo's fault.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][color=#ffd966]Mods that alter the same cells as Inigo?[/color][/size]\n<br />[size=2]This mod temporarily alters Snow Point Beacon, and permanently alters a section of a nearby mountain to the East of the Beacon just over the first rise. I'm sure there are other mods out there that affect the same areas and therefore could cause issues, but so far not many have been reported. If you spot something contact me with the name of the conflicting mod and info on how exactly it interferes (if at all) with INIGO. Thanks :)[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb][size=4]Anything that replaces tree meshes - Tropical Skyrim, etc[/size][/color] [size=2]may make it appear that an item you need to collect is floating in mid air. Just open the console and type tcl then hit enter to reach the item if need be.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb][size=4]Warzones 2015[/size][/color] [size=2]renames a few of the same cells that Inigo touches. There should be no impact from these changes, but it would be a good idea to place INIGO after WZ in your load-order. In particular, 'Langley's House Ext.' is a rather important cell for INIGO in that it places some objects and quest markers.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb][size=4]Enhanced Landscapes [/size][/color][size=2]drops a chunk of mountain on Langley's cabin and the path to it. There is now an [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25522?tab=files]Enhanced Landscapes - Inigo Patch[/url] available for this in \"elwaps' Guides and Enhanced Landscapes Patches\".[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#6d9eeb][size=4]CC Bloodchill Manor [/size][/color][size=2]has the entrance blocked by the path up to Langley's cabin. Elianora came out with a compatibility patch at once, see patches near the top of this page.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=4]His back-story doesn't fit my play-through![/size][/color]\n<br />[size=2]It probably does. Whatever you decide becomes his understanding of the truth. The matter of your shared past can be discussed and settled one way or another once you've completed his mini-quest. It may take a little while for him to come to terms with the truth if you decide you don't share a past, but he'll get there in the end and the exchange that leads to his acceptance can play out in a few different ways.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=4]Kajitt no speek liek Indigo! Fix it!! [/size][/color]\n<br />[size=2]Speech is cultural not racial. Just like you, Inigo's vocal patterns and accent were defined by his environment and culture. It would make zero sense for Inigo to use third person pronouns considering his background.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=4]Convenient horses support/Enemies attacking Inigo's horse?[/size][/color]\n<br />[size=2]For the most part Inigo ignores CH (a side effect of having him on his own framework). He does however have his own horse riding features. Read more about all that above in the horses section.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff0000](NOTE) [/color][/b]There is an occasional minor conflict with Convenient Horses (a problem with the hand off of the horse from CH to Inigo's riding system) that can cause everything to want to target his horse, but it is easily solved with a simple console command if it happens to you. \n<br />\n<br />[b]With Inigo's horse in clear view, open the console (~), select Inigo's horse with the mouse and type:\n<br />\n<br />addfac 2E894 -1\n<br />\n<br />Hit enter and exit the console.[/b] (There is a space between the faction ID and the -1.) Don't worry, it won't hurt anything if the faction was already set like that, \n<br />or if you don't have CH. Ask in the comments if you want the long explanation as to why/how this happens.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=4]Can I translate Inigo?[/size][/color]\n<br />[size=2]PM me if you think you can. Be warned, Inigo frequently uses wordplay, rhyming, and phrases with multiple meanings. This makes translation tricky. He also has over 7000 lines as of V2.1. You'll need to be genuinely fluent in English and a bit of a creative linguist.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=4]His unusual colouring sucks!! It huts my eyes!!! Argh! [/size][/color]\n<br />[size=2]If you don't like Inigo because of the colour of his fur I'm afraid that's your problem not his. There are good narrative/character reasons for this decision and I won't be changing it. Most people have no issue with this whatsoever, but despite there being a 'lore friendly' reason provided in the mod explaining why he looks the way he does, I regularly hear from players who are initially put off by his colouring - Hence the existence of this note. I'm not trying to push some kind of external agenda other than interesting character building. Giving Inigo more to push against and overcome makes him far more enjoyable to write, and also allows me to introduce conversations that wouldn't be possible with a more normal looking individual – dysmorphia, etc. Inigo rewards those who can see him for who he is by simply being himself. I never created Inigo to be popular so if this is a deal-breaker for you then I see it as no great loss. It's almost become a meta commentary on prejudice and what it can cause one to miss out on. :P[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=4]Can I marry Inigo? I... (blushes) I... think I love him![/size][/color]\n<br />[size=2]No. I'm afraid a marriage option is unlikely. There are good narrative reasons for this choice. Never say never but Inigo is first and foremost a friend.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=4]Why can't Inigo warp to keep up?! Pffft! YOU'RE AN IDIOT!![/size][/color]\n<br />[size=2]Inigo doesn't have any kind of warping script at all. It's not that hard to do, but it has a number of downsides that the reward you receive for completing his\n<br />mini-quest  avoids (complete his mini-quest if you don't have it yet). I prefer moment to moment control over where Inigo goes. I'm just speaking personally, but warping often doesn't mesh with how I play and it occasionally spoils certain moments - especially moments I'm working on for V3. I prefer that Inigo keeps his autonomy and goes his own way, even if that means he can't always keep up when I'm bouncing over mountains. It may sound crazy, but I feel it helps maintain the sense that he's a real person. While the reward you receive for completing his mini-quest isn't as convenient as a warp, it was designed to be used frequently in a way that's hopefully entertaining and useful (hence the multitude of responses). In the end it's down to personal preference, but since I'm really making Inigo for me I don't plan on adding a warp feature. Sorry.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=4]Why is Inigo overpowered?! It's not fair! Waaah![/size][/color]\n<br />[size=2]Most of Inigo's high attack damage is a result of his high level starting gear. He is an experienced warrior who has had many adventures you were never a part of so he also has a few perks that aid him when using weapons he's proficient with.  You can nerf him by swapping out his ebony weapons for iron or steel versions (don't lose his bow).  His two handed skill is low so you can limit his damage output even more by forcing him to fight with low level two handed weapons. Inigo comes with an optional low level set of gear which can be found in the chest in his cell (see the User Guide Video).\n<br />\n<br />You can also adjust Inigo's Attack Damage with this console command: \n<br />\n<br />forceav AttackDamageMult X \n<br />\n<br />Where X is the new value. For example 1.2 = 120% and 0.8 = 80%[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=4]Why can't Inigo move in with me?! Damn you!!![/size][/color]\n<br />[size=2]Inigo is a friend, not a housecarl. He has better things to do with his spare time than house sit. That said, if you ask him to relax in your home (or anywhere safe) he'll do so indefinitely. Until his main quest has reached its conclusion (in V3) he'd rather spend his free time in a place that encourages contemplation. He has his reasons and will even share them with you under the right circumstances. He doesn't need or want anything fancy. He may find a new place to call home when his quest is over, but he will want to do it on his own terms.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=4]Can I turn Inigo into a werewolf or a vampire?! I want to! I want to!![/size][/color]\n<br />[size=2]No. See the warning at the top of the page? If you try to control Inigo with other mods you'll break his brain. Don't do it. Inigo actually has a conversation about this subject (which alters depending on what you are) where he will explain why he's not interested in such 'gifts'. This conversation is only available once you've settled the matter of your shared past.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=4]I lost him! I lost his stuff! Damn my eyes![/size][/color]\n<br />[size=2]He comes with a map marker (See the \"Map Marker\" section above or watch the User Guide Video). You will also find the reward for completing his mini quest helps a great deal. \n<br />\n<br />If you've lost his bow, books, Mr D or Inigo here are some useful console commands kindly implemented by CdCooley.[/size][/font]\n<br />[size=3][color=#ffffff]\n<br />setpqv InigoStatus Recover Inigo (Move him to your position)\n<br />setpqv InigoStatus Recover MrD (Puts Mr D in front of you no matter where he was)\n<br />setpqv InigoStatus Recover Bow (Gives one to Inigo if neither of you have it)\n<br />setpqv InigoStatus Recover Books (Gives them to Inigo but only as many as appropriate for his quest stages)\n<br />[/color][/size]\n<br />[line]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=5]CREDITS[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=4][b]Gary Hesketh (AKA Smartbluecat)[/b][/size][/color] ---- Everything that's not hard-core coding \n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=4]CdCooley[/size][/color] ---- All the hard-core coding\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=5]THANKS[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffd966][size=4]Cdcooley[/size][/color] [color=#ffffff](He saved my cat.
