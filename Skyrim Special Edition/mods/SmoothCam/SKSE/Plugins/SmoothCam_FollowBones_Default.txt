// Any file in the SKSE plugins folder starting with the name "SmoothCam_FollowBones_" will be loaded and parsed by SmoothCam.
// Bone names in this file are used to select the starting camera position height for the player and are selected based on
// what matching bone name is found first. SmoothCam will search this list in descending order, so if you want to override
// a bone, place it higher up in the list (Or include your bones in a file with a name that SmoothCam will load earlier).

// Each bone should be placed on a separate line and the name should be an exact match to what is found in the skeleton.
// You can add comment lines by starting the line with '//', but you cannot place comments anywhere on the same line as a bone!
// (You think I'm writing a proper parser for this?)

// I've included some bone names for most of the vanilla skeletons here, with what *should* be decent locations for the
// camera to follow, starting with the highest priority bones to look for, descending to the last-resort bones.
