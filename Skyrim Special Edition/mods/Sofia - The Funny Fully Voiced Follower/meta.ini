nexusDescription="[youtube]uJ6OZ8r2uZc[/youtube]\n<br />[i][size=2]Note: Trailer features the original Skyrim version.[/size][/i]\n<br />\n<br />[u]About Sofia\n<br />[/u]\n<br />[size=2]Sofia is a humorous and advanced fully voiced follower voiced by the talented Christine Slagman (finalCrystine). Sofia is voiced to the very highest of quality and Christine has a rather extensive list of Skyrim mod credits from Falskaar to Helgen Reborn and Interesting NPCs where she played the loveable Misha amongst others.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Sofia is fully location and quest aware (currently just the main quest and bounty quests) and will comment on the player character and her surroundings. She has her own custom dialogue system which allows for longer and more detailed dialogue.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Sofia is quite an unusual follower. She is tough, witty and just a little bit boastful. She has a strong fondness for the player character but her deliberate attempts to disguise the fact just leads to very awkward conversations especially as she usually says exactly what she thinks. Sofia is a tease and loves to wind people up which doesn’t make her very popular with people. Her rebellious spirit and careless attitude often gets her in trouble. Not to mention her constant inappropriate comments which easily offend or embarrass people.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]If you give Sofia alcohol as a gift she will drink it and become physically drunk which changes all of her dialogue to also sound drunk. If you ask her to sing she will sing some familiar Skyrim tunes but with the wrong lyrics or her own new songs written by Christine. When you start riding a horse she will summon her own and start riding alongside you. You can also set her personal horse using with a spell. You can also set her dismiss location where she will hang out and do her own thing. If she falls behind then don’t worry because she will intelligently spawn behind the player character when out of view. She also has her own storage. She has an MCM menu where you can adjust adjust comment frequency and the catch up feature as well as combat settings.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://i.imgur.com/gpHxE3l.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=4]How To Start[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />[size=2]Go to the Whiterun stables, wake her up and agree to invite her along with you. Bring some clothing for her (don't worry she's not fully nude). Note: when I say the stables I mean where the horses are kept and not the building. She will be laying in the hay.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=4]Installation[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />[size=2]Either use a mod manager or install manually by dropping the files into \"C:&#92;Program Files (x86)&#92;Steam&#92;steamapps&#92;common&#92;Skyrim Special Edition&#92;Data\" and then make sure you activate the mod in Data Files in the Skyrim launcher or your mod manager. ALWAYS put Sofia BELOW any follower enhancement mods such as AFT, UFO and EFF in your load order.\n<br />\n<br />[/size]I highly recommend you check out the Sofia Bug and Patch Hub by mattski123 here: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70950]https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70950\n<br />[/url]You should also post any bugs you are having over there and he may be able to create a patch for it.\n<br />\n<br />[center][url=http://www.skyrimgems.com][img]http://i.imgur.com/hXQSy.png[/img][/url][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#ff0000][size=4]Winner of Gamespot's Follower of the Year 2014[/size][/color][/u]\n<br />[youtube]2cNYPMzQTKg[/youtube]\n<br />[size=2](Skip to 6:09)[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ffff00][size=4]Featured on Skyrim Mods Weekly &amp; GameSpot[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[youtube]JFzjYBrJLi4[/youtube][youtube]NwKKnH6_TAQ[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=4]Credits[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />[size=2]John Jarvis – Creator, writer, developer, scripting.[/size]\n<br />[size=2]Christine Slagman (finalCrystine) – Voice of Sofia, audio editing, additional writing, beta testing and additional help.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]Christine is really talented so you should go and check out her other stuff too :)[/size]\n<br />[url=http://www.christine-slagman.wix.com/portfolio]Christine's Website[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=3]Other Cast[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />[size=2]Josh Griffiths - Crooked Priest of Mara[/size]\n<br />[size=2]Temperance10 - Whiterun Guard[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=3]Used Resources[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6709/?]DIMONIZED UNP female body by dimon99[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35267/?]SG Female Textures Renewal by Hello Santa[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10168/?]Apachii Skyhair by Apachii[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35092/?]Apachii Skyhair Natural Re-texture by Aron[/url]\n<br />[url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12951/?]Enhanced Character Edit by ECE team\n<br />[/url][url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/7305/?]UNP Female Armors by Exeter[/url]\n<br />\n<br />Follow beside player feature adapted from [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62863/?]Followers as Companions by IsharaMeradin[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]You may not redistribute any part of this mod without my permission.

Where is she?[/u][/b]\n<br />[size=2]By default she will be be at the Whiterun stables.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]I can't find Sofia![/u][/b]\n<br />[size=2]Use her summon spell in the spell menu or tracking marker found in the quest journal under miscellaneous quests which can be toggled. If neither of these show up then it is very likely that Sofia is not installed or activated correctly in your game.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]I gave Sofia alcohol and now she's glitched out.[/u][/b]\n<br />[size=2]Type [b]stopquest jjsofiadrunk[/b] . Sofia should now be out of drunk mode.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Sofia is unresponsive/Sofia is totally bugged out and behaving crazy.[/u][/b]\n<br />[size=2]Try clicking on Sofia with the command console open in game and use the command resetai . If this doesn't work try the disable command and then enable right after. If that doesn't work and you wish to keep your save then you will need to fully reset Sofia.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Full reset instructions:[/b][/u][size=2] Take all your belongings from Sofia (see below if you are unable to retrieve your belongings), dismiss her then make a save far away from her, then go out of the game and deactivate the esp plugin SofiaFollower.esp. Load up the same save and save again. Now go back out of the game again and reactivate the esp plugin and then load up the previous save and she will be back at the stables.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=2]If you are unable to retrieve your belongings due to her glitched out state then open the console, click on Sofia and then use this command: \"openactorcontainer 1\" (without the quotes) to force her inventory to appear. To get to her storage items you will need to do \"coc jjsofiastore\" which will take you to a room where her storage container is kept.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Can I marry Sofia?[/u][/b]\n<br />[size=2]Yes. Get her relationship to 100 via giving her gifts and talking to her, clear 5 dungeons and get 100 kills with her present and spend 30 days with her. You should now be able to ask her to marry you via the \"Can I talk to you for a bit?\" dialogue option.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Do I need any other mods?[/u][/b]\n<br />[size=2]No. Sofia is totally standalone and already has all the required files.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]I don’t like Sofia’s dialogue/voice/this mod.[/u][/b]\n<br />[size=2]I don't care. Go make your own follower.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Is Sofia lore friendly?[/u][/b]\n<br />[size=2]She is designed to be but don’t get all anal about it if it’s not 100 percent in your eyes. Opinions will always differ.[/size]"
