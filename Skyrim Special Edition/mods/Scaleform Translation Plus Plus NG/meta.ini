nexusDescription="\"I am aware the game has updated. I don't have a lot of time/energy to work on these things anymore, and I will my mods on my own time. Stop contacting me.\"\n<br />\n<br />- Fudgyduff, aka Ryan, creator of the orignal [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22603]Scaleform Translation Plus Plus[/url].\n<br />\n<br />Rather than posting yet another comment on the Scaleform Translation Plus Plus modpage asking for an update to the new Skyrim version I just did it myself.\n<br />\n<br />Source code is available on my [url=https://github.com/VersuchDrei/ScaleformTranslationPP/]GitHub[/url].\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />The offsets inside of the function this is invoking have been changing inbetween AE versions and this cannot be handled by address library alone, so there is considerable chance this will break if a new Skyrim update comes along. It has been successfully tested on 1.5.97, 1.6.640 and 1.6.659 and should also be working on 1.6.318 and 1.6.353. If your Skyrim crashes on startup this most likely means your Skyrim version is not supported.\n<br />\n<br />I will most likely not add any more updates to this other than maybe bugfixes or support for new Skyrim versions if there are more to come."
