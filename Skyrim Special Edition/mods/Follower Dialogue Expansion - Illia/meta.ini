I don't want you to share their fate.\"[/size][/color][/i]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c9daf8][size=4][b]How is Illia envisioned and touched on in this mod:[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />In this mod, Illia is expanded as a [b][color=#ffff00]good witch who seeks redemption[/color][/b] from the sins of her mother. She spent much of her life secluded in Darklight Tower, and therefore understands little of the civilized world's ways; but now she has helped you end her mother's witch coven, and has no one to trust or rely on but you.\n<br />\n<br />Her story begins as a child born under dark and sad circumstances, as her father was murdered by a noble who lusted after her mother. In grief and wrath, Illia's mother sold her soul and her daughter - still in her womb - to the Darklight Coven and the Daedra, just to gain vengeance on the noble. They got exactly what they asked for, and now they would spend an eternity to pay the Hagravens back.\n<br />\n<br />Illia became estranged to her mother, as the crones in Darklight Tower abused her just for leisure. Despite that, she remained a good mage in defiance of the Hags and her mother, and only participated in their evil deeds when forced. At times, she would escape the tower to glimpse the world outside, but she always returned to its darkness - [b][color=#ffff00]for all its horrors, the tower was familiar, while the civilized world was alien. [/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Everything changed when she helped you bring down her mother's coven. [b][color=#ffff00]Now, with nowhere and no one else to turn to, she places her trust in you[/color][color=#c9daf8].[/color][/b] Will you fail her, or [b][color=#ffff00]redeem her from the dark world she was forced to call home?[/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />She is available as a follower after the completion of the quest \"Repentence\" in Darklight Tower. She is a frost mage with healing abilities.\n<br />\n<br />In the mod, Illia has a wise demeanor with a subtle, dry sense of humor. She is grateful to you, and gratitude may grow into something much more in the form of friendship or romance.\n<br />\n<br />---\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c9daf8][b]Features:[/b][/color]\n<br />1. Expands Illia with 628 lines, all voiced by high quality AI (see the video for reference)\n<br />2. Quest awareness for the Companions questline, College of Winterhold, vanilla main quest and DLC main quest, Hagraven-related content\n<br />3. New story-driven interactions\n<br />4. New romantic lines if she is married\n<br />5. Location-awareness, including cities and dungeons\n<br />6. Approval system\n<br />7. Completely lore-friendly, expanding rather than completely rewriting the character\n<br />8. Immerse into your game world as a character who lives in it, rather than taking over the show\n<br />\n<br />This mod is [b]100% compatible with any mod[/b], including dialogue expansion mods from other authors.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Safe to add mid-save.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />There is a potential for [b]future expansion[/b] with Illia, including [b]optional[/b] synergy with the overarching Shezarrine Saga\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Illia is particularly reactive to College of Winterhold with many deeply written insights.[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]di9ngVu89Ko[/youtube]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Q&amp;A\n<br />\n<br />1.

Does she have any content related to your Shezarrine mod?\n<br />Not at the moment. If I add it in the future, it will be optional\n<br />\n<br />7. Will there be a FOMOD for the whole series?\n<br />You are free to make one, as long as it requires the original mod (this mod).\n<br />I don't know how to make FOMOD.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Credits:\n<br />Anbeegod - Writer, audio editor\n<br />ElevenLabs - Voice generation\n<br />rxkx22 - Screenshot\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Patrons:\n<br />Marilyn Boyd\n<br />KITO.KOTARO 鬼頭 晃太郎\n<br />Maria\n<br />Mr. K\n<br />boogie\n<br />atrtatte\n<br />Tobias Skansen Knudsen\n<br />Marwin33\n<br />Valerian777\n<br />Rebecca Alex\n<br />William Glass\n<br />Vengeful Potato\n<br />Tidega\n<br />Doe John\n<br />Nunya\n<br />Turklander61\n<br />Clypse\n<br />FM07\n<br />Taylor Stuckey\n<br />Thycrow\n<br />Jan Niklas Wilken\n<br />Willie Stehnach\n<br />DARTYN\n<br />Bathrobe SamuraiB\n<br />Wai Keong\n<br />Angusburger1\n<br />Op-Tron\n<br />Indvir Dhillon\n<br />GasMaskGhoul\n<br />Harrison Been\n<br />Prophet\n<br />Reee\n<br />Sev\n<br />Thien Nguyen\n<br />ZER0零\n<br />AlextheGreat\n<br />Austin Kirby\n<br />Fisal Al Omran\n<br />Darwin Corbell\n<br />Bosh\n<br />hana120\n<br />Kevin Lewis\n<br />Dm6190\n<br />Nosy Tommy\n<br />Broom\n<br />Michael Banks\n<br />Ahumar Coggins\n<br />Andre Trowell\n<br />J Giles\n<br />Alex Castner\n<br />Austin Kirby\n<br />DarkPhoenix\n<br />Lagavulin\n<br />JaunetheRNJR\n<br />Peter Q Pan\n<br />shwomplr\n<br />David Roman\n<br />Rymer\n<br />Charles Redmond\n<br />Milkydromeda\n<br />Thanos Papadopoulos\n<br />dave\n<br />Witted Guy\n<br />BigJiggl\n<br />Mirko.Givo\n<br />RDT45\n<br />Montrealporter\n<br />sauron67\n<br />Mink Muskens\n<br />Clément\n<br />Brock Underwood\n<br />Gideon\n<br />Wade Sanders\n<br />Cross 666\n<br />meh\n<br />Dojari\n<br />Gerardo Alfredo Bisnar\n<br />Ben Harrison\n<br />Bear Pawses\n<br />Loic scognamiglio\n<br />David Relin\n<br />Broji\n<br />Caleb Branco\n<br />AzhariMaikui\n<br />Christopher Godfrey\n<br />zenozeno\n<br />Carlos Miguel\n<br />Gabriel Collins\n<br />Tri57\n<br />Brandon Oliver\n<br />Mero The Rebel\n<br />Paul Burchard\n<br />VishCookie\n<br />Pavel\n<br />Mark\n<br />Falon Peddle\n<br />Lars\n<br />TooSkinny4U\n<br />Mac Mütze\n<br />Rogan Yeoh\n<br />jon\n<br />Alexander Burdett\n<br />Robert\n<br />Benjamin Kreft\n<br />Morpheaus\n<br />skulexander\n<br />bladestorm92\n<br />Dky117\n<br />22peter22\n<br />john\n<br />Sphincks\n<br />SparaticSpartan\n<br />David Hamilton\n<br />Silence EXE\n<br />Eduardo Lenz\n<br />Ronald Brashear\n<br />Yu Wang\n<br />Abyss Hunter\n<br />Jose Roncero\n<br />Nick Ettinger\n<br />Kara Elise\n<br />Cyberneon\n<br />Cbaori\n<br />Delamain\n<br />Jordan Lopez\n<br />Peter Schneider\n<br />james hebert\n<br />Lageron\n<br />Dock\n<br />Fanguy59\n<br />Gavin Wood\n<br />Kyle Ivy\n<br />Mark\n<br />Samakovarnost'\n<br />VeryClassyDemon\n<br />Josh Viljoen\n<br />Krisu Westis\n<br />john smth\n<br />Rubén Gutiérrez López\n<br />NirevS\n<br />Lancelot456123\n<br />STOCK JAR\n<br />Kiraya\n<br />Joel Johansson\n<br />John Osborne\n<br />Auctor Lucan\n<br />Frank Brackett\n<br />rs801\n<br />Brandon Burgos\n<br />Gregory Thomas\n<br />NeighborCookies\n<br />Ragnar the Red\n<br />Randolph T Schreck\n<br />Foley13368\n<br />Fluffer's friend, Jason!\n<br />StarshockNova\n<br />Kire Xtrans\n<br />Patrik Slamka\n<br />NegiAg\n<br />igor volevatch\n<br />Calvin Walker\n<br />Kim\n<br />kthenm\n<br />Keith\n<br />Vallen Ely\n<br />Ryan Corley\n<br />David Mills\n<br />Alex Silva"
