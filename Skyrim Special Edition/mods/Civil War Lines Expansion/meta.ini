By adding around 500 new lines that are not shared between voice types, the members of these factions will feel more unique and have more to say. Lines are always attached to conditions, so they will only come up in relevant scenarios, making the NPCs seem more alive than ever before.\n<br />\n<br />This builds upon what I did with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63733]Bandit Lines Expansion[/url], so you could consider it a type of sequel to that one.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />F E A T U R E S\n<br />\n<br />1) Adds new lines to generic civil war members.\n<br />2) Doesn't remove any vanilla lines, it just adds new ones. Up to 100(!) new lines per voice type. (~500 total)\n<br />3) Lines are spliced from vanilla lines, no computer-generated lines, so they should sound quite natural.\n<br />4) Compatible with everything, no patches needed.\n<br />\n<br />Lines go from combat, warnings, idles, to everything in between. Using conditions, these lines will reflect your actions in the world appropietly, helping you feel like your choices and actions actually matter.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][youtube]jVBwtrgmlhg[/youtube][/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][b][size=4]Examples of lines (and their conditions). \n<br />[/size][size=1]Keep in mind the mod adds almost 500 of these.[/size][/b][/center][u]Civil War Related:[/u]\n<br />\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />- [b]All these damn Stormcloaks around here...

Your support means a lot![/size]\n<br />\n<br />Everyone who tuned in on Twitch to help with the development of this mod!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/0DhnyTT.png[/img][/center]\n<br />[b]Can I install this mid-game?\n<br />[/b]Yes.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Is this compatible with X?\n<br />[/b]Yes.\n<br />\n<br />[b] Is this flagged ESL?\n<br />[/b]Yes.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Can you answer something other than yes?\n<br />[/b]Yes.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Err... this is getting awkward.\n<br />[/b]Yes. [size=1]Okay, I'll stop now.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]How are the lines in terms of quality?\n<br />[/b]I'd argue they're extremely well done this time. Most of them didn't need much splicing in the first place. This is because MANY of the lines were \"one-time\" lines that you only hear once in the entire game for scripted sequences, now repurposed to play whenever it's appropiate. Example: during the intro of the game when you're with either Hadvar or Ralof, you will encounter Stormcloaks/Imperials and they'll be like \"STORMCLOAKS, GET THEM!\" and then you never hear this ever again. Well, now you do. Same with lines such as \"It's in the clouds! A dragon!!\" and similar.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Do ONLY Civil War member benefit from the new lines?\n<br />[/b]Mostly yes. However, similar to the latest [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63733?tab=logs]Bandit Lines Expansion[/url] update, I'm opening some lines from this mod to any NPC that shares the same voice type. Some of the most generic lines are universally fitting in all contexts. Things that either a bandit, a random citizen or a soldier could say. One example of this: Most NPCs can now react to seeing a friend die in combat, something that could never happen in vanilla and that benefits the game greatly.\n<br />\n<br />[b]This is great but... Any \"weak\" points to the mod?\n<br />[/b]Currently, when you enter a cell with many imperials/stormcloaks, they might talk over each other briefly if they all want to say their lines at the same time. I try to prevent this but it still happens sometimes. They should calm afterwards though.\n<br />\n<br />[b]You showed [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/images/165479]a teaser[/url] a couple of weeks ago... Where are the Thalmor? where are the Forsworn?! You filthy traitor, where are they?!\n<br />[/b]The mod was originally going to cover those 4 factions all in one, adding up to 750 lines. This was... too much and I was having issues finishing even this first part. So the solution was to cover Imperials/Stormcloaks now in this mod (which has the same size as Bandit Lines Expansion) and leave Forsworn/Thalmor for whenever I feel strong enough to finish the other mod. Lines are already spliced and selected, just need to find the motivation to add them into the game and test the hell out of it. Stay tuned!\n<br />\n<br />[b]What's next?\n<br />[/b]Besides the mod mentioned above, I have many mini mods in the works or practically done.
