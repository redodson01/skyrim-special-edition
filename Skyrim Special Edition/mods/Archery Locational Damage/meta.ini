nexusDescription="[size=4][b][color=#00ff00]Now compatible with both SE and AE version.[/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[b]Introduction[/b][/size]\n<br />Getting tired of enemy taking dozens of arrows to the head and still standing?  With this mod, now you can teach them the pain of getting hit in the head.\n<br />\n<br />Arrows that hit the player and NPCs can now do different damage and effect depending on the hit location. \n<br />Any enchantments on the weapon also become stronger with location damage multiplier.\n<br />\n<br />There are two INI presets to choose from\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ffff][size=3][b]INI - Simple[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Head[/color]: 2.0x damage, 25% chance of knockdown and 50% chance of stagger.

(The player is not affected by disarm because it's no fun trying to find your weapon dropped in a dark cave, re-favorite, re-set hotkey and re-equip it.)\n<br />[color=#6aa84f]Legs[/color]:  1.0x damage, Reduced movement speed. 25% chance of stagger.\n<br />Other: 1.0x damage, no special effect.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ff00][size=3]INI - Complex[/size][/color][/b]: For version 1.3 or newer.

You need to do at least 25% of the target's max HP in damage to have the maximum chance described above. This can be changed in the INI.\n<br />\n<br />[/color][b][size=4][color=#cc4125][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51073]powerofthree's Tweaks[/url] [/color][color=#dd7e6b]is required for special on hit effects to work.\n<br />\n<br />[/color][/size][/b][color=#f4f4f4][size=4][b]Shot difficulty bonus EXP[/b] [/size][/color][color=#00ff00][size=2]New feature[/size][/color][color=#f4f4f4]\n<br />[/color]From version 2 onward, the difficulty of shot will affect the EXP gained from hit. Factors that affect shot difficulty include arrow flight time, target distance, target movement, target size and location difficulty setting.\n<br />\n<br />The amount of EXP bonus from various factors can be changed in the INI.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Installation\n<br />[/b][/size]Extract all files to \"Data\" folder of your Skyrim installation folder or use mod organizer.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Uninstallation[/b][/size]\n<br />This mod is not using any Papyrus script and does not modify anything in the game so it should be safe to uninstall at anytime.\n<br />Delete ArcheryLocationalDamage.dll and ArcheryLocationalDamage.ini from Data/SKSE/Plugins/ folder.\n<br />Delete ArcheryLocationalDamage.esp from Data folder.\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4]Customization\n<br />[/size][/b]The INI file can be customized to suit your taste on hit effect if the default settings do not satisfy you.\n<br />\n<br />You can define a new hit location by adding a new section named [LocationX] with X being the location ID.\n<br />\n<br />If there are more than one rule that match the same hit location then the rule with lower ID will take precedence  and the other rules will be discarded.\n<br />\n<br />With the power of regular expression, you can define your rule once and it'll match any target hit if their hit location name matches the rule.\n<br />\n<br />There's also an option to use keywords to filter what types of actor should the rule apply to. In the default setting, the neck is not considered a weak point for dragon, machine and undead.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700]The hit location must has a collision object![/color]\n<br />\n<br />If you don't know what the body part's name is, go into the INI file. There is a setting that will show the name when it's not matched by any rules so you can use those name in it.\n<br />\n<br />Example: Getting hit at the body part with name contains \"Spine\" has 25% chance to apply paralysis to the target (This is only example and should not be used for real. Because the part with name \"Spine\" cover the most of the body's hitbox.)\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c9daf8][Location5]\n<br />Regexp = .*Spine.*\n<br />Message = This message will display as a notification on location hit\n<br />HitSound = Editor ID of sound you wanted to play when this location is hit\n<br />Multiplier = Damage multiplier when getting hit at this location[/color]\n<br />\n<br />This mod is using spell system to apply special effects, you can open the Creation Kit and create your own effect and set it as a  hit effect. You can even create an effect that launch the enemy into orbit if you shoot them in the legs or using a scripted effect spell to summon an illusion to attack them when you hit them in the head. By default, the mod does not add any script to the game. If you're adding a scripted effect to the game then you must ensure that all scripted effects are not running on any actor before uninstalling to avoid potential problem.\n<br />\n<br />You can define your additional effects in the same INI section at the location. There's no limit on how many additional effects can be added per location.\n<br />\n<br />Use \"Effect\" option to specify additional effect to apply on hit. Use a number followed by a % and then followed by an editor ID of a spell you want to apply like this:\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Effect [/color]= [color=#00ff00][b]50[/b][/color]% [color=#00ff00][b]EffectEditorID[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />Adding to the example above, the section now look like this\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c9daf8][Location5]\n<br />Regexp = .*Spine.*\n<br />Message = This message will display as a notification on location hit\n<br />HitSound = Editor ID of sound you wanted to play when this location is hit\n<br />Multiplier = Damage multiplier when getting hit at this location\n<br />Effect = 25% EditorIDofParalysisSpell[/color]\n<br />\n<br />If you want an additional effect for this location then do this:\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c9daf8][Location5][/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]Regexp = .*Spine.*[/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]Message = This message will display as a notification on location hit[/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]HitSound = Editor ID of sound you wanted to play when this location is hit[/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]Multiplier = Damage multiplier when getting hit at this location[/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]Effect = 25% EditorIDofParalysisSpell[/color]\n<br />[color=#6fa8dc]Effect = xx% AdditionalEffectID[/color]\n<br />\n<br />The effect that will be used for additional effect should be using [color=#ffe599]\"Fire and Forget\"[/color] casting type and [color=#ffe599]\"Contact\"[/color] delivery type. Using \"Aimed\" delivery will resulting in a projectile fired from the shooter to the target instead of instantly apply its effect.\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b]Keyword Filter[/b][/size]\n<br />If you want to restrict a location to certain actor, add following keyword filtering setting to the location setting to filter what actor should be using the rule. (There's an example in the INI file)\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700]KeywordInclude[/color] - The target must match this keyword condition to apply locational damage.\n<br />[color=#ff7700]KeywordExclude[/color][color=#616161] [/color][color=#f4f4f4]- The target must NOT match this keyword condition to apply locational damage. [/color][color=#ea9999][b](Override KeywordInclude if matched)[/b][/color]\n<br />\n<br />If a keyword filter is defined with multiple comma separated keywords in a single line, then an actor must has ALL of the  keywords to match the filter. (Like AND condition)\n<br />\n<br />If a location has multiple KeywordInclude or KeywordExclude lines then at least one of the line must match the rule. (Like OR condition)\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700][size=3]As of v2, there are 4 types of keyword filter. [/size][/color][color=#dd7e6b][size=3]Old syntax without prefix from v1 is no longer supported.[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />Keyword prefixed with \"[color=#00ff00][b]A:[/b][/color]\" is \"[b][color=#00ff00]Actor Keyword[/color][/b]\" which mean the actor must have the keyword(s) on itself or its race.\n<br />Keyword prefixed with \"[b][color=#00ff00]E:[/color][/b]\" is \"[b][color=#00ff00]Equipped Keyword[/color][/b]\" which mean the actor must have the keyword(s) on its equipped items.\n<br />Keyword prefixed with \"[b][color=#00ff00]M:[/color][/b]\" is \"[b][color=#00ff00]Magic Keyword[/color][/b]\" which mean the actor must have the keyword(s) on its active magic effects.\n<br />Keyword prefixed with \"[b][color=#00ff00]W:[/color][/b]\" is \"[b][color=#00ff00]Weapon Keyword[/color][/b]\" which mean the attacking weapon and ammo must have the keyword(s) on them.\n<br />\n<br />Equipped and magic keyword can be joined with [b][color=#00ff00]+[/color][/b] to enforce matching on a single effect or item.\n<br />\n<br />All types of keyword can also prefixed with [b][color=#00ff00]-[/color][/b] to negate its meaning which will match when the target is NOT having the keyword.\n<br />\n<br />Example of using keyword filter to include NPCs only:\n<br />[color=#f6b26b]KeywordInclude = A:ActorTypeNPC\n<br />\n<br />[/color]To include when the target is wearing any heavy armor:\n<br />[color=#f6b26b]KeywordInclude = E:ArmorHeavy\n<br />\n<br />[/color]For when the target is using master level armor spell: (The effect must have both keywords)\n<br />[color=#f6b26b]KeywordInclude = M:MagicArmorSpell+RitualSpellEffect\n<br />\n<br />[/color]Or when the target is using non-master level armor spell: (The effect must NOT have ritual spell keyword)\n<br />[color=#f6b26b]KeywordInclude = M:MagicArmorSpell+[/color][color=#00ff00][b]-[/b][/color][color=#f6b26b]RitualSpellEffect\n<br />\n<br />[/color]If you want to detect if the target is wearing full armor regardless of light or heavy, use [color=#00ff00][b]comma[/b][/color] to separate entries like this:\n<br />[color=#f6b26b]KeywordInclude = E:ArmorHelmet[/color][color=#00ff00][b],[/b][/color][color=#f6b26b] E:ArmorCuirass[/color][color=#00ff00][b],[/b][/color][color=#f6b26b] E:ArmorGauntlets[/color][color=#00ff00][b],[/b][/color][color=#f6b26b] E:ArmorBoots\n<br />[/color]\n<br />Multiple of the same keyword can also be used to detect if the actor is wearing full heavy armor(4 pieces) like this:\n<br />[color=#f6b26b]KeywordInclude = E:ArmorHeavy, E:ArmorHeavy, E:ArmorHeavy, E:ArmorHeavy\n<br />\n<br />[/color]Or combined with the above example to check for at least 3 pieces of heavy armor but allows any helmet:\n<br />[color=#f6b26b]KeywordInclude = E:ArmorHelmet, E:ArmorHeavy+ArmorCuirass, E:ArmorHeavy+ArmorGauntlets, E:ArmorHeavy+ArmorBoots[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f4f4f4]Example usage of keyword filter if you don't want headshot to trigger when the target is wearing any helmet.[/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8][Location1][/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]Regexp = .*(Head|Eye|Nose|Jaw|HEAD).*[/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]Message = Head shot![/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]HitSound = UISneakAttack[/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]Multiplier = 2.0[/color]\n<br />[color=#f6b26b]KeywordExclude = E:ArmorHelmet\n<br />\n<br />[/color]Or if you want to restrict the helmet protection on heavy armor helmet only:\n<br />[color=#f6b26b]KeywordExclude = E:ArmorHelmet+ArmorHeavy\n<br />\n<br />[/color]Or if you want to reduce damage done by headshot to 1.5x when wearing a helmet and normal 2x when not then do this:\n<br />Add KeywordInclude filter to Location1 to make it to trigger only when an actor is wearing a helmet. (and optionally set the hit sound to metallic clang)\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c9daf8][Location1][/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]Regexp = .*(Head|Eye|Nose|Jaw|HEAD).*[/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]Message = Head shot against a helmet![/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]HitSound = WPNImpactBladeVsArmorSD[/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]Multiplier = 1.5[/color]\n<br />[color=#f6b26b]KeywordInclude = E:ArmorHelmet\n<br />\n<br />[/color]Then set a new location below Location1(because lower ID will take precedence)  to trigger it on anyone else not having the ArmorHelmet keyword. (Make sure to copy any effects defined in Location1 to Location5 if you want the same effect to trigger)\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c9daf8][Location5][/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]Regexp = .*(Head|Eye|Nose|Jaw|HEAD).*[/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]Message = Head shot![/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]HitSound = UISneakAttack[/color]\n<br />[color=#c9daf8]Multiplier = 2.0[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ff00]Additional option for location setting added in version 1.3[/color][/b]\n<br />[color=#ff7700]SuccessChance[/color] - Percentage chance of success for the location to trigger when the condition is met.\n<br />[color=#ff7700]SuccessHPFactor[/color] - Percentage of max HP of the target to scale the success chance based on incoming damage vs max HP. (Negative value = higher chance with lower damage)\n<br />[color=#ff7700]SuccessHPFactorCap[/color] - If set to false, the success chance can exceed the defined chance when incoming damage is high enough.\n<br />[color=#ff7700]Deflect[/color] - Will deflect incoming arrow if set to true. (Does not affect incoming damage)\n<br />[color=#ff7700]ImpactData[/color] - Replace arrow impact effect with this by using Impact Data's editor ID.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ff00]Additional option for location setting added in version 1.5[/color][/b]\n<br />[color=#ff7700]RaceInclude[/color] - A regular expression for filter what race should be used in current location.
