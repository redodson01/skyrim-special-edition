nexusDescription="[center][img]https://www.afkmods.com/modbanners/gildergreen-regrown-logo.jpg[/img][/center]\n<br />\n<br />Danica asked you for sap from the Eldergleam to revive the dead Gildergreen in Whiterun. Instead, Maurice convinced you to bring back a sapling. All is now well in Whiterun, except for one small thing. That sapling deserves to grow into a nice big healthy proper replacement for the dead tree you helped get rid of.\n<br />\n<br />For those who followed the path of renewal in Blessings of Nature, but missed out on seeing the full size live tree in all its glory, this mod is for you. Now you don't have to choose the path of violence and destruction if you don't want to. Your sapling will now grow over the course of 6 in-game months from a tiny bud into a full bloom tree you and the city can be proud of.\n<br />\n<br />Kynareth shall smile on you for your kind ways.\n<br />\n<br />[center][url=https://www.patreon.com/arthmoor][img]https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png[/img][/url][/center]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=4]Installation Requirements[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />Skyrim Special Edition 1.6.1130 or greater.\n<br />Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch 4.3.2 or greater.\n<br />\n<br />[color=red]DO NOT extract the contents of the BSA file into your Data folder as loose files, or let your mod manager perform an equivalent function on the contents of the file. Doing so will cause things to load in the wrong order and break the game. Skyrim is intended to load a BSA alongside it's ESM/ESP file. Circumventing this causes issues which I will not provide support for. If you insist on going against this advice, you will receive no support for the problems you generate as a result of this.[/color]\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Installation - Wrye Bash BAIN[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />Drop the archive into your Skyrim ModsBash Installers folder, then install as usual.\n<br />Make sure the mod is active in the Wrye Bash mods tab.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Installation - Nexus Mod Manager[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />Use the \"Download with Manager\" button on the Gildergreen Regrown page at Skyrim Nexus. The installer should take care of things from there.\n<br />Then simply make sure NMM has the mod activated.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Installation - Manual[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />Drop the Gildergreen Regrown.esp and Gildergreen Regrown.bsa files into your Data folder.\n<br />Activate the mod using whatever management tool suits you.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Uninstall[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />Due to the nature of Skyrim mods, especially those adding scripts, it is strongly discouraged to attempt uninstalling a mod from your active game. Any mod that is more than pure mesh or texture replacements has the possibility to leave behind permanent changes to your save that you may not want. This is not something modders can correct for. It is how the game was designed by Bethesda. No support will be provided for anyone who uninstalls this mod from an active game and continues on with that save.\n<br />\n<br />Uninstalling this mod after the vanilla sapling grows one stage but before the vanilla adult tree grows in will result in there being NO tree, not even the dead one.\n<br />\n<br />You'll need to allow things to run their course before removing the mod.\n<br />\n<br />Remove the two files from the Data folder.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Known Issues[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />None, thank God.\n<br />\n<br />[u][b]Compatibility[/b][/u]\n<br />\n<br />Compatible with Open Cities Skyrim.\n<br />\n<br />Does not overlap any changes in the Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.\n<br />\n<br />Should work with other Whiterun mods so long as they do not also touch the Gildergreen.\n<br />\n<br />Contains no modified vanilla scripts.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Disclaimer[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod is not made, guaranteed, or supported by Zenimax, Bethesda Game Studios, or any of their affiliates."
