The mod does add new conditions to a couple of vanilla taunts/flee lines to filter them out during the brawls, but I've forwarded the conditions of the most popular mods that change their conditions (Hunters not Bandits, RDO, USSEP...) So yeah, compatibility shouldn't be an issue.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- \"I've never experienced these dialogue bugs, how comes?\"\n<br />[/b]It seems they are more apparent by using certain mods. There's also a random factor to them. In any case, this mod comes bundled with both the fixes and the new dialogue, so there should be something for everyone.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- Does this replace \"Modern Brawl Bug Fix\" or similar?\n<br />[/b]No, my mod is only dealing with dialogue changes. So this mod is compatible with those mods.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- \"After I installed this mod, the brawling is no longer working or is giving me issues!\"\n<br />[/b]Not possible. This mod is only dealing with dialogue changes. It does not edit the quest at all. Your problem is elsewhere.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- \"Why would you limit some of the banter? I loved when my brawling partner would say things like \"I'll have your head on a pike!\"\n<br />[/b]Listen, I love me some brawling banter, but it was often a bit out of place for a friendly fist fight. The objective is to knock your enemy out, not to behead them and put their heads on a pike. I know it's all happening in the heat of a fight and all, so the banter is still there, but non fitting lines are mostly filtered out.\n<br />\n<br />[b]- \"I like this mod.
