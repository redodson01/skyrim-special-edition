nexusDescription="These are vanilla hair meshes for human races with higher poly count (hence smooth hair), UV tweaks, some tweaks to bone weights and detailed 3d braids.\n<br />I'm novice at these things, so the meshes aren't perfect, but I've done it as well as I could.\n<br />\n<br />This mod was inspired by kebrus' Better Vanilla Hair. You can find his mod [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28491/]here[/url]﻿.\n<br />\n<br />I have taken a few liberties with a few hairstyles' design, so if you don't like those, there's nothing I can do.\n<br />\n<br />Only human races for now, but if possible, I might do other races as well.\n<br />\n<br />Do let me know if you come across any issues. I hope you like it. :)"
