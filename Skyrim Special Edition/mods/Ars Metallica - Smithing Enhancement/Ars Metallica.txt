Ars Metallica
=============

A simple mod to expand on the crafting system in Skyrim.

The crafting system is one of Skyrim's better features, but for thieves and archers, there's not much use for the system. Light armor is dead easy to come by in already finished forms, but arrows can sometimes be scarce in the types you may want. Lockpicks have been known to be somewhat scarce too, yet are relatively basic to construct.

Ars Metallica aims to fill in some of the basic issues I had with the crafting system by doing the following:

For vanilla Skyrim:

* Allow archers to forge their own arrows out of the various ore materials, wood, leather strips, and feathers. Indirectly making it somewhat useful to chop wood too.
* Allow thieves to make their own lockpicks out of iron or steel. This doesn't mean you have to be a member of the Thieves Guild.
* Provide skill advancement for the use of the smelter to melt down ore. After all, that's as important as knowing how to shape it once refined.
* Provide skill advancement for the use of the tanning rack to make leather. That's far more important in my mind than the skill advances from using the leather to make stuff.
* Provide for a small amount of skill advancement from mining the ore itself out of ore veins.
* Provide the ability to melt down existing pieces of armor and some clutter items into ingots so that you can then use those ingots to make missing pieces of a set if you want.
* Allow members of factions to forge equipment appropriate to their guild. Thieves can make guild armor. Assassins can make Brotherhood armor, and so on.

For Dawnguard:

* Modifies the dragonbone arrow recipes and the crossbow bolt recipes to conform to the same formulas as vanilla. Disabled Dawnguard's native recipes.

For Hearthfire:

* Provides smithing experience for using the various workbenches used to construct your homes. The drafting table does not count since nothing is actually built using it.

For Dragonborn:

* Modifies the stalhrim and nordic arrow recipes to conform to the same formulas as the vanilla arrows.
* Adds smelting formulas to recover ore from stalhrim and nordic carved equipment.
* Adds crafting feathers to the Felsaad Tern.

Note that all smelting of metals requires that you know the perk associated with that metal. For example, if you wish to smelt Dwemer scrap, you need to know the Dwemer Smithing perk first. This applies not just to smelting existing goods but also to smelting raw ore. This isn't a bug, it's a feature.

Installation Requirements
=========================

Skyrim Special Edition 1.6.1130 or greater.
Requires Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch 4.3.2 or greater.

DO NOT extract the contents of the BSA file into your Data folder as loose files, or let your mod manager perform an equivalent function on the contents of the file. Doing so will cause things to load in the wrong order and break the game. Skyrim is intended to load a BSA alongside it's ESM/ESP file. Circumventing this causes issues which I will not provide support for. If you insist on going against this advice, you will receive no support for the problems you generate as a result of this.

Installation - Wrye Bash BAIN
=============================

Drop the archive into your Skyrim Special Edition Mods\Bash Installers folder, then install as usual.
Make sure the mod is active in the Wrye Bash mods tab.

Installation - Manual
=====================

Drop the Ars Metallica.esp and Ars Metallica.bsa files into your Data folder.
Activate the mod using whatever management tool suits you.

Uninstall
=========

Due to the nature of Skyrim mods, especially those adding scripts, it is strongly discouraged to attempt uninstalling a mod from your active game. Any mod that is more than pure mesh or texture replacements has the possibility to leave behind permanent changes to your save that you may not want. This is not something modders can correct for. It is how the game was designed by Bethesda. No support will be provided for anyone who uninstalls this mod from an active game and continues on with that save.

To remove the mod: Delete the Ars Metallica.esp and Ars Metallica.bsa files from your Data folder. Then reload your game as usual.

Version History
===============

Version 2.0.8 [2024-07-22]
--------------------------

The .esp and .bsa files have been changed to lowercase filenames. This is to help facilitate universal filename compatibility for Steam Deck and regular linux users whose file systems are case sensitive. Many of them make use of the in-game menu to download mods and Bethesda.net ALWAYS downloads in lowercase. For the benefit of people using linux or the Steam Deck, it would be greatly appreciated if any mods which currently use Ars as a file dependency change the case of that dependency in their master lists. (Bug #34096)
Updated arrow recipes added by Saints & Seducers and Rare Curios to require crafting feathers and leather strips. (Bug #33683)

* A new feather object has been created called "Crafting Feathers" and will replace the pheasant and chicken feathers. This will be added as drops on hagravens and hawks as well.
  + Any pheasant feathers you are carrying will be automatically converted into the new type when the game loads. Pheasant feathers stored in containers or on the ground will be converted when you pick them up. Chicken feathers were directly edited to become crafting feathers so they are already taken care of.
* Added a patch file to provide proper support with Dawnguard installed.
  + This add-on file disables Dawnguard's own arrow recipes in favor of the ones requiring feathers and leather strips.
  + Crossbow bolts will now require feathers and leather strips, but the yield has been raised to 15 instead of 10.
