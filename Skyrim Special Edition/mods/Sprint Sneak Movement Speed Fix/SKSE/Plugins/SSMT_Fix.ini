## Attempt to fix several instances of the game applying incorrect movement types while wielding weapons.
#
#  What's covered:
#
#   - Incorrect movement type may be applied if a shield, melee or ranged weapon is drawn while moving *
#   - The default movement type (NPC_Default_MT) may be applied instead of NPC_Attacking_MT during melee left hand attacks if a spell or staff is equipped in the right hand.
#
#  * This issue is barely noticable on vanilla because the movement types involved are very similar.
