nexusDescription="This is a mod that originally started as a joke, but ended up being way more useful than I thought.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ff7700][size=3][u]Background:[/u][/size][/color][/b]\n<br />There is a lot of evidence that reloading a save in Skyrim can lead to many issues. The game does not clean up after itself properly and old references can stay in memory, that can cause bugs to appear in the reloaded save ranging from minor issues to straight up breaking quests.\n<br />\n<br />While this won't fix all issues related to saving and loading in general, the ones related to reloading should be gone. \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3][b][color=#ff7700][u]How it works:[/u][/color][/b][/size]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]When you attempt to load a save (or you die and the game is reloading the last save), the mod checks if it's the first time you do it.\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*]If it's the first time, the save will be loaded, otherwise the mod will start a completely new instance of the game.\n<br />[/list][list]\n<br />[*]The save you selected will be loaded automatically after the game was reloaded. You don't have to press any buttons.\n<br />[/list]\n<br />As a downside, this will increase loading times.\n<br />On my hardware, this process takes about 10 seconds form the moment of pressing the quick load button to the end of the loading screen. \n<br />This was measured while standing around Whiterun, unmodded, with the game running from an SSD, so this is a best case scenario.\n<br />This can obviously wary greatly depending on your setup. At the end of the day, it's up to you if you want to use this mod or not.\n<br />\n<br />Just to be clear: This won't affect loading screens that happen when opening a door, or any other ones that are not associated with reloading a save.\n<br />[b]\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=3][u]Known issues:[/u][/size][/color][/b]\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]If you attempt to load a save that is corrupted, the game will hang on the Main Menu without anything showing up.\n<br />Just open the console and type \"qqq\" and restart your game normally.[/list][list]\n<br />[*]The mod only supports the following SKSE launcher arguments:\n<br />[/list]   [i]   ﻿-priority, -affinity, -altexe, -altdll﻿, [/i][i]-forcesteamloader[/i]\n<br />   ﻿If you use any other than these it will have no effect on your game after a reload.\n<br />   ﻿This should not affect 99% of the users, and if you are then I assume that ﻿you know what you're doing.\n<br />   ﻿Note for priority and affinity: These values will be preserved, but if it was modified while the game was running, it will use the modified values.\n<br />[color=#ff7700]\n<br />[u][b][size=3]Compatibility:[/size][/b][/u][/color]\n<br />Don't use it with other mods or .ini tweaks that load a save on game startup, as it could cause an endless loop of reloads, while the mods fight each other.\n<br />It should be compatible with pretty much anything else.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ff7700][size=3][u][b]Permissions and source:\n<br />[/b][/u][/size][/color]The mod is released under the MIT license.\n<br />[url=https://github.com/Vermunds/Skyrim-CleanSaveAutoReloader]Source code\n<br />[/url]"
