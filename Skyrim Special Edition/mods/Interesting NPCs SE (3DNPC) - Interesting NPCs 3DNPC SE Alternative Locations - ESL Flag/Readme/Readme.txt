3DNPC - Alternative Locations

For users of Live Another Life and Hearthfire Lakeview Manor expansion mods

Moves:

Among the Hist to a custom location ('Autumnshade Cave') in the vicinity of Boulderfall Cave. Due to time constraints, the cell is a duplicate of Pinemoon Cave. I cleaned up unnecessary markers and made the cell smaller. Pertinent quest and note were modified to reflect the changes. Tested both 'Escape from Cell' and 'Warlock's thrall' starts and they work fine. Note: the 3dnpc trigger script that starts his scene when you first enter the cave was not edited. It was set to kill the necromancer in Boulderfall Cave, and this will still happen when you enter the new cave. Given that you are not, in fact, entering BF Cave it shouldn't matter too much.

Fjona's Familiar is still inside the Abandoned Prison but moved to a different location. Tests show that he doesn't get into fisticuffs with the vanilla ghost residents any more. The only thing that would break this is if you use a mod enhancing AI detection range greatly.

Carmella has been relocated near the cairn and six graves near HalfMoon Mill. The two vanilla skeletons there are disabled. This isn't a satisfactory solution by any means but it's time consuming to look for a good spot so this will have to do for the moment.
