nexusDescription="A cut, and slimmed down version of RDO that removes some of the feature creep/bloat.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]-Use this mod on a new game, do not replace your RDO full on your current saved game.\n<br />\n<br />-The cutting room and USSEP patch are no longer needed and should not be used with this; just load CRF after RDO!\n<br />\n<br />-The AI Overhaul patch is still required and works fine.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][i]Here's what was removed, as detailed as possible:[/i][/u]\n<br />\n<br />[b]ARMOR[/b] -  Three single records, one of which was for an added follower.\n<br />\n<br />[b]BOOK[/b] -  One spell tome (Fade Other), and the RDO Bard Edda Verse.\n<br />\n<br />[b]CELL[/b] -  Placed NPCs/objects, holding cells.\n<br />\n<br />[b]CLASS [/b]-  For the added followers.\n<br />\n<br />[b]COBS[/b] -  RDO Scaled Armor (removed up top in ARMOR)\n<br />\n<br />[b]CONTAINER [/b]-  RDO holding cell container (removed in CELL)\n<br />\n<br />[b]COMBAT STYLE[/b] -  For the added followers.\n<br />\n<br />[b]DIALOGUE TOPIC[/b] -  This is trickier to go through in briefness; most of what was removed were single records that pertained to the added followers, and an added bandit NPC.\n<br />\n<br />[b]DIALOGUE BRANCH[/b] -  Same thing here; most of what was removed had to do with those added followers/NPCs/objects.\n<br />\n<br />[b]OBJ EFFECT [/b]-  This was two records for the added armor.\n<br />\n<br />[b]FORM ID LIST[/b] -  I removed the 'aaa_RDOPreventedActorsList' in version 1.1; not sure what this is, but it's very empty, no list of formids underneath it.  Previously removed: _RDOEncOrcHuntersFemale, _RDOMPxExcludedActors, _RDOWEAdventurerBrawlerSubChar, a_CustomSpellList (this one looked fishy to me), _RDOEncHunters\n<br />\n<br />[b]LEVELED NPC[/b] -  One record:  _RDOWERoadNobleSubChar\n<br />\n<br />[b]MAGIC EFFECT[/b] -  This was a big one.  Reported crashes were stemming from magic battles with RDO installed; there were some very odd, single records that affected VANILLA magic effects in here, so shouldn't that all be green looking?  I would say so; when I tweak magic effects in Skyrim, I do a copy as override.  Why on Earth would we need more than one magic effect that affects the same spells?  Jury's out on that one, but CTD was being reported; now those effects are gone.  Oh, and the invisibility eye mesh fix, which is now redundant with the eye fixing mods that we all have access to in 2019.\n<br />\n<br />[b]MISC ITEM[/b] -  One record:  a_RDOFFGrelkaSatchel\n<br />\n<br />[b]NPC[/b] -  EVERYTHING, for obvious reasons.\n<br />\n<br />[b]OUTFIT [/b]-  Two follower outfits.\n<br />\n<br />[b]PACKAGE[/b] -  Another lengthy one; only single records regarding RDO's added followers and NPCs, including Terik, were removed.  Vanilla records were left intact.\n<br />\n<br />[b]PERK[/b] -  One perk:  a_RDODualFlurry, whoever that was for.\n<br />\n<br />[b]QUEST[/b] -  Same thing as Package, lots regarding added followers/NPCs, including Terik, and its quests (the Grelka thing/Bard Edda?). Vanilla left intact.\n<br />\n<br />[b]RELATIONSHIP[/b] -  Again, added followers.\n<br />\n<br />[b]SCENE[/b] -  Two records:  One for Kaie, another for Terik.\n<br />\n<br />[b]STORY QST NODE[/b] -  One record:  a_RDOKaieConfrontQuestNode\n<br />\n<br />[b]SPELL[/b] -  See MAGIC EFFECT.\n<br />\n<br />[b]WEAPON[/b] -  Kaie's Sword of Leeching/Harvesting (obviously explains the dual flurry perk.)\n<br />\n<br />All scripts that looked vanilla affecting and important for functionality are included, but scripts pertaining to added magic effects, quests, followers, etc were removed.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][i][u]There was also a list of mods that are known to require the full version of RDO:[/u][/i][/b]\n<br /> \n<br />A-Maging Companions Required for mod to work\n<br />Addison Companion With Several Versions And BONUS Adoptable Cutie\n<br />Alexstrasza Follower\n<br />Algus Thadalfus Follower required for this mod\n<br />Anna Christmas Elf_Vanilla And Standalone With Multiple Voice Options Full HDT\n<br />Arch-Curate Vythur Follower - Vampire and Mortal\n<br />AS Companions Complete Required for followers to work properly\n<br />Authentic Sinding Follower\n<br />Autumn's-Gate house and Mannimarco follower Altmer voices\n<br />Azarimar Dunmer Follower and Standalone Needed in order for the voice to work properly (For RDO Version)\n<br />Balthier Follower - RDO required for this mod\n<br />Blueinith's Elven men\n<br />BucketHead needed to recruit buckethead\n<br />Butterfly - Standalone Follower Follower dialog will fail to appear without it\n<br />BUVARP - Barely Used Vanilla Actors Recycle Project\n<br />Calaveras Vampire Companion required for this mod\n<br />Cattleya Follower from Queen's Blade - Jinxxed Followers I believe this is needed to make Rana work\n<br />Crethia follower\n<br />Diana Vampyre 2020\n<br />Dominion Followers Not needed for mod to work only needed for a few followers to work.\n<br />Double Trouble\n<br />Dx's Follower - Freston Family Required for Ragnar and Thoralf\n<br />Elandil Maormer Follower Needed for voice and follower commands\n<br />Estrion - Altmer Male Follower\n<br />Follower Artesia - Artesia the Xinobi -\n<br />Follower Canna - Canna The Little Magician -\n<br />Follower Nirya - 2018 Edition - SCE Hard requirement for both BAT and ESP; enables Nirya's voicetype to be used for follower dialogue\n<br />Gerdur NPC Replacer_Follower_Marriageable_UNP\n<br />Gracie - Standalone Follower\n<br />Halena and Daylee - Standalone Elves Followers Follower dialog will fail to appear without it\n<br />Herfjotur Follower Required for mod to work\n<br />Invasion of Skyrim - Grand Admiral Thrawn 2.0 - The Balance of Power\n<br />Kiyomi - Standalone Follower Follower dialog will fail to appear without it\n<br />Kynareth Goddess And Daughter Kelsea\n<br />Largo Follower Required for RDO version\n<br />Liadys Follower Pack for Khajiit voice\n<br />Makeo - Standalone Follower Follower dialog will fail to appear without it\n<br />Malacoda Follower Standalone and RDO Required for non-standalone version\n<br />Maxine - Zombie Follower and Adoptable  - REPORTED COMPATIBLE (Thanks to user Ruhadre)\n<br />Maxine - Zombie Follower and Adoptable Spanish - REPORTED COMPATIBLE (Thanks to user Ruhadre)\n<br />Niroku Followers It is necessary for M'rasa, but MOD works even without it.\n<br />Noelle or Samus Aran (METROID) - Standalone Follower\n<br />Nordic Beauties of Skyrim required for mod to work\n<br />Nymph Girls of Skyrim\n<br />Peregrine Highwatch HFX Needed along with EFF in order to hire the Imperial Phantom as a follower (normally not hireable in vanilla).\n<br />Raeza - Follower and Adoptable\n<br />Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - RDO - polish translation\n<br />Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - RDO German\n<br />Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - RDO Spanish\n<br />Rosalia - Standalone Follower Follower dialog will fail to appear without it\n<br />Rosie Vampire Follower in case she not follow\n<br />Sanyon Exiled Thalmor Follower Feat.
