I took a few artistic liberties here and there, such as making clothes worn by wealthier NPCs more colorful and making civilian/workers clothes dirtier and less colorful, for example. But overall, my goal was for people to be able to look at my retextures and still recognize the original designs. I know the term \"vanilla +\" can mean so many things, but this is what it means to me. Making skyrim look better while still looking like skyrim.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This is the biggest project I have ever worked on and have put hundreds of hours into it. I truly hope you will all enjoy the result\n<br />[b][u][size=4]\n<br />WHAT IS INCLUDED?[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />This mod covers all vanilla clothing (except the jester set which will be coming in an update to my dark brotherhood retexture), DLC clothing and clothing from the following CCs: Winter, Lords mail (green and yellow redguard variants), Dead man's dread and Fishing. I also included a retexture of the  swords from CC dead man's dread, simply for ease of download.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />This mod also contains optional Retextures for [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10644]Oblivion Artifacts Pack SE[/url], [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19002]Armor &amp; Clothing Extension[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72772]Extended Cut Saints &amp; Seducers[/url]\n<br />\n<br />You will also find a few options such as added sleeves for jarls' outfits and snow or snow-less versions of the skaal outfit.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][b][u]\n<br />FOMOD OPTIONS\n<br />[/u][/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Fomod lets you pick and choose what you want. \n<br />\n<br />Chest/robes textures are 4k, everything else is 2k\n<br />\n<br />Half-res version available in Optional files (chest/robes are 2k, everything else 1k)\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=3]Low-res version also available in Optional Files (chest/robes are 1k, everything else is 1k)[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]BASE INSTALL[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]\n<br />[size=5]VANILLA ITEMS[/size][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Either install everything or pick and choose exactly what you want.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b][u]CHILDREN CLOTHES[/u][/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/qLOfHG7.png[/img]\n<br />[/size][size=2]\n<br />Retextures the children clothes, including the variants added by heartfire[/size]\n<br />[size=2]\n<br />\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b][size=4][u]DARK ELF CLOTHES[/u][/size]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/jjxoXKI.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Retextures the dark elf clothes added by the dragonborn DLC[/size][size=2]\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[size=4][b][u]EXECUTIONER'S OUTFIT\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/Q0gZZzN.png[/img]\n<br />[/u][/b][/size]\n<br />Retextures the executioner set\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][u]FARMERS[/u][/size][/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/kFcn1gY.png[/img]\n<br />Retextures all farmer and regular civilian clothes, including the mourner and vampire variants added by the dawnguard DLC\n<br />\n<br />[b]FINE CLOTHES[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/PdjWqMq.png[/img]\n<br />[size=2]Retextures all the fine clothes, worn by wealthy NPCs and the wedding dresses.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]JARLS AND EMPEROR[/b]\n<br />[size=2][img]https://i.imgur.com/3kOHKI0.png[/img]\n<br />Retextures the jarls, emperor and ulfric clothes, including the female version of ulfrics set added by WACCF[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b]PRISONERS AND BEGGARS[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/tEXg4YO.png[/img]\n<br />Retextures the clothes worn by prisoners and beggars, including the blood variants added by the dawnguard DLC, the gag worn by ulfric in the intro and the execution hoods worn by the dark brotherhood victims \n<br />\n<br />[b]REDGUARD CLOTHING[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/PCzF0uA.png[/img]\n<br />Retextures the redguard clothes including the Dark brotherhood variant worn by Nazir\n<br />\n<br />[b]SHEOGORATH'S OUTFIT[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/UKD7PIC.png[/img]\n<br />Retextures the ourfit worn by Sheogorath\n<br />\n<br />[b]SKAAL CLOTHING[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/EZWfs4U.png[/img]\n<br />Retextures the clothing worn by Skaals, in the dragonborn DLC\n<br />\n<br />[b]UNDERWEARS[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/UxyUzdC.png[/img]\n<br />Retextures the underwears\n<br />\n<br />[b]WORKERS' CLOTHING[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/mCYxeWs.png[/img]\n<br />Retextures the Barkeeper, blacksmiths, chef, merchants, miners and wenches clothes\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][u][b]CREATION CLUB ITEMS[/b][/u][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=4]FISHING\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/u][/b][img]https://i.imgur.com/tvDUJpY.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Retextures the fishing clothes[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=4][u]WINTER\n<br />\n<br />[/u][/size][/b][img]https://i.imgur.com/PsSgWK9.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]Retextures the Saturalia outfit\n<br />\n<br />[/size][size=4][b][u]DEAD MAN'S DREAD\n<br />[/u][/b][/size][img]https://i.imgur.com/64itgWO.png[/img]\n<br />[size=3][img]https://i.imgur.com/jF3YoIL.jpeg[/img]\n<br />Retextures all clothes and swords from dead man's dread.[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=4]LORDS MAIL\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/nF4jZkn.png[/img]\n<br />[/size][/u][/b]Retextures the green and yellow variants of the Alik'r clothes added by lords mail\n<br />﻿﻿\n<br />[size=5][b][u]SKAAL[/u][/b][u] OPTIONS[/u]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][left][b]WITH SNOW (VANILLA STYLE)[/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/EZWfs4U.png[/img]\n<br />[size=2]Like the vanilla version, this version has snow baked on the textures.

The female version already has sleeves, this will only change the male's set. Armor &amp; clothing extension also adds an extra sleeved variants, which I offer a consistency patch for. So I only recommend using this option if you do not use ACE. Optional ESP-FE to add proper 1st person meshes\n<br />[/left][b][u][size=5]CONSISTENCY PATCHES[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />These are optional retextures for some of my favorite mods. All the original mods are required and while I took inspiration from the originals, none of these textures used any parts of the original textures found in these mods. \n<br />[size=4][b][u]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center]ARMOR AND CLOTHING EXTENSION\n<br />By Kryptopyr and Gamwich[/center][/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[/size]﻿While I took great inspiration from the original textures made by Gamwich, I did not use any of them in any shape or form during the making of this mod, outside of looking at them for inspiration. My goal was not to improve them, as they are already incredibly well done, but to redesign these clothes to fit better with my own style. Please view these as an alternative to the original work and not an attempt at objectively \"improving it\".\n<br />[u][size=3]\n<br />JARLS VARIANTS AND SLEEVES[/size][/u]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/O3FA3CF.png[/img]\n<br />[size=2]Covers the whiterun, riften and markarth jarl sets and the sleeved jarls.[/size]\n<br />[b]\n<br />[size=3]TAVERN CLOTHES VARIANTS[/size][/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/aN9rTXo.png[/img]\n<br />Covers the 4 extra variants for the female tavern clothes\n<br />\n<br />[u]\n<br />[/u][center][b][u][size=4]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=4]OBLIVION ARTIFACTS PACK SE\n<br />by WatcherZero[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[/center]\n<br />[b][u][size=3]APRON OF THE MASTER ARTISAN\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/7L0UnzL.png[/img]\n<br />THE DECEIVER'S FINERY[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/RIlhB3w.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[center][size=4][b][u]EXTENDED CUT SAINTS &amp; SEDUCERS\n<br />By ECSS Dev group\n<br />\n<br />Theodor Gorlash's outfit \n<br />\n<br />[/u][/b][/size][img]https://i.imgur.com/L5lzMru.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][size=4]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[/center]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][b][size=5]If you like my work, check out my other mods [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/users/10028290?tab=user+files]here[/url]﻿![/size]\n<br />[/b]\n<br />[size=5]Want to know what's next?
