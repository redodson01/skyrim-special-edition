Just a basic readme about recommended usage of the functions script.
You'll mostly want to focus on the animation part of the script, which is the DoAnim() functions.

Advise your users to not "START" the mod with the MCM and disable functions that might conflict and then call
the animations from your mod's side.

Since I'm replacing animations with OAR, the animation "IdleKneeling" must be playing in order for the other animations to work.

-- Check carcass idle - Initial animation

In your mod, you can call this animation from your script or use ihFunctions.DoAnim() and set a timer if you want(around 0.8 seconds).

-- Types of dagger

	If fForcedDagger
		; Uses forced dagger by another mod
		fHuntingDagger = fForcedDagger
		iTypeOfDagger = 1
		CreateDisplay()
	Else
		; check for available daggers in player inventory
		If iForcedTypeOfDagger <= 1
			GetLastEquippedDagger()
			CreateDisplay()
			iTypeOfDagger = CheckForDagger()
		Else ; Uses forced type of dagger by another mod
			iTypeOfDagger = iForcedTypeOfDagger
		EndIf
	EndIf

If using Immersive Equipment Displays, the mod will look for the last equipped dagger by default with the option to "stop" updating the dagger.
If your mod have some sort of Hunting Knives, you can "force" the knives to the animations.

When calling the function, set the parameter fForcedDagger with the record of your mod's dagger/knife.
If your mod requires a dagger/knife but the player does not currently carry it, you can set the parameter iForcedTypeOfDagger, to use a "sharp rock" or "claws" if player is argonian/khajiit, refer to ihFunctions.CheckForDagger().

-- Process animation

This animation (when using a dagger) is the combination of Skinning and Butchering/Harvesting. You can call it by using ihFunctions.DoAnim(isProcess = True).
If you want to use the realistic skinning included with the mod, also set akTargetRef and ihFunctions.fHuntingPelt.

-- Skin animation

The skinning animation can be called by using ihFunctions.DoAnim(1).
If you want to use the realistic skinning included with the mod, also set akTargetRef and ihFunctions.fHuntingPelt.

bToggle determines if it's a failure, if your mod has a "failed" skin action, you can set the parameter to true.
isSmall determines if the carcass is from a small animal or not, you can set the parameter abForceSmall to true or use ihFunctions.CheckTypeOfAnimal(akTargetRef)

-- Harvest animation

The harvest animation can be called by using ihFunctions.DoAnim(2).
If using Immersive Equipment Displays, set the "hunting material" object to be used before calling the animation: ihFunctions.fHuntingMaterial = your mod harvested item.

bToggle determines if it's a failure, if your mod has a "failed" harvest action, you can set the parameter to true.
isSmall determines if the carcass is from a small animal or not, you can set the parameter abForceSmall to true or use ihFunctions.CheckTypeOfAnimal(akTargetRef)

-- Butcher animation

The butcher animation can be called by using ihFunctions.DoAnim(3).
If using Immersive Equipment Displays, set the "hunting food" object to be used before calling the animation: ihFunctions.fHuntingFood = your mod butchered item.

bToggle determines if it's a failure, if your mod has a "failed" harvest action, you can set the parameter to true.
isSmall determines if the carcass is from a small animal or not, you can set the parameter abForceSmall to true or use ihFunctions.CheckTypeOfAnimal(akTargetRef)

-- Remove arrow animation

The remove arrow animation can be called by using ihFunctions.DoAnim(4).
If using Immersive Equipment Displays, set the "hunting arrow" object to be used before calling the animation: ihFunctions.fHuntingArrow = your mod arrow item.
Also set the parameter akTargetRef.

-- Extract animation

The extract animation can be called by using ihFunctions.DoAnim(5).
If using Immersive Equipment Displays, set the "hunting potion" object to be used before calling the animation: ihFunctions.fHuntingPotion = your mod potion item.

-- Ending animation
After all actions are finished, you can call the ihFunctions.EndAnim(True) and ihFunctions.StandUp()

StandUp can also be used to dispose the carcass, should you wish to.

-- Pick up animation
If your mod has a pick up function, you can call the ihFunctions.doPickupAnim() with the value corresponding to the carcass
